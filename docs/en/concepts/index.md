# Basic concepts

In this chapter, you will find a concise but clear explanation of several basic concepts. Portfolio performance is all about numbers. It is easy to completely miscalculate or misinterpret these numbers, if you don't understand the underlying assumptions.

- [Financial terminology](financial-terminology.md): Understanding basic financial terminology is crucial for optimal usage of PP and this manual. This page contains a few links excellent sites.
- [Account](account.md): An account is a collection of [transactions](transaction.md). PP uses several terms to indicate the concept of account: Securities, Deposit, Reference, Cash, Offset, ... account. What do they mean and in what aspects do they differ?
- [Transaction](transaction.md): A financial transaction is an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. In case of PP, the exchange is about securities. There are security transactions such as buy, sell delivery (inbound), and delivery (outbound); deposit transactions such as deposit, removal, interest, interest charge, fees, fees refund, taxes, tax refund; and dividend transactions.
- [Reporting period](reporting-period.md): The (reporting) period is the time slice that is taken into account for reporting (calculations, graphs, statistics). It's very important that you realize that for every performance calculation a reporting period is taken into account, even if you haven't set one explicitly.
- [Purchase value](purchase-value.md): The Purchase Value of a security is the summed value of each buy (+) and sell (-) transaction of that security, taken into account the [reporting period](reporting-period.md). The value of a transaction includes the taxes and fees; sometimes also called “Net Transaction Value”.
- [Performance](performance/index.md): Measuring your portfolio's performance may seem straightforward, but it involves a range of concepts and calculation techniques that require explanation.
