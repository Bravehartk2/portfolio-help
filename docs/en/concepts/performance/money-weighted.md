title: Money weighted rate of return
---

The money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) is a measure of the performance of an investment between two dates ($t_{0}$ and $t_{n}$). It is expressed as an annual interest rate that is necessary to bring the initial value of the investment at time $t_{0}$ to the final value at time $t_{n}$ and in fact, it is essentially equivalent to the Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The IRR of an investment is defined by equation (1).

$$V_S * (1 + r) + \sum_{t=1} ^{n}C_t * (1 + r)^{\frac{dte}{365}} = V_E \qquad\mathrm{(Eq 1)}$$

where $V_S$ = the start value of the investment or portfolio, $V_E$ = the end value of the portfolio, $C_t$ = the external cash flow on day *t*, and $dte$ = the number of days to the end of the period.

Let's try to apply Eq 1 to our demo-portfolio-03. The IRR for a 3 year period (e.g. from 2020-06-12 to 2023-06-12) is equal to 28.28%.

The portfolio is empty at the start of the reporting period on 2020-06-12. The first share is bought on 2021-01-15. The start value $V_S$ = 0. The end value $V_E$ is 426.82 EUR. This is the result of the dividend payment, the partial sale of share-1 and the market value of the remaining `share-1` and `share-2` on 2023-06-12. This final result is made possible thanks to the buying of share-1 and share-2 at the respective dates. However, the 155 EUR, spent on 2021-01-15 is now (2023-06-12) worth 241.68 EUR. This is the [Future Value](images/info-irr-future-present-value.svg) of this cashflow from the perspective of the buy-transaction. The formula is: $C_t * (1 + r)^{\frac{dte}{365}}$. For example, the future value of 100 EUR after one year with an interest rate of 10% is 110 EUR = 100 * (1 + 0.10). But what interest rate should you use? The IRR is that interest rate that make the sum of the future values of all cashflow equal to the final value of the portfolio, e.g. 426.82 EUR.

!!! Note
    Why aren't dividend payments and share sales considered external cashflows? Certainly, the funds originate from outside the portfolio. However, they are generated by a share. In that regard, they are no different from the capital growth of a share. Moreover, the dividend payment is deposited into a cash account, and nothing further happens with it until the end of the period. At that point, the portfolio is settled, and the dividend payment and sales results are included in the $V_E, along with the capital growth of the share.

    If, however, you immediately reinvested the dividend, the purchase of those new shares would be recorded as a cashflow on that date. The cash account would then be credited, naturally reducing to zero, and consequently, it would no longer impact $V_E.

The IRR can be measured for a specific trade, security or the whole portfolio. Here's a simple example. Additionally, there is also a more complex [Practical step-by-step example](../irr-example.md), solved in PP.

!!! Example
    On `2021-01-15`, you purchased 10 shares at 17 EUR each.
    As of today (`2023-06-15`), the price has risen to 18.5 EUR per share. During this period, you received a dividend of 1.5 EUR per share on `2021-09-10` and a second dividend of 1.7 EUR per share on `2022-09-10`.

What is the performance or IRR of this security? Let's first have the timing and cashflows correct.


Table: Cash flows at different times of investment.

| Date       | $t_n$ | $CF_n$           |
|------------|-------|------------------|
| 2021-01-15 | 0d    | 170€             |
| 2021-09-15 | 243d  | 15€              |
| 2022-09-15 | 608d  | 17€              |
| 2023-06-15 | 881d  | 185€             |

According to (1)

$$CF_{t0} = 170 = \frac{15}{(1 + IRR)^\frac{243}{365}}+\frac{17}{(1 + IRR)^\frac{608}{365}}+ \frac{185}{(1 + IRR)^\frac{881}{365}}$$

What IRR will solve this equation (1)?

In Figure 1, we reverse the scenario: What's the value of $CF_{t0}$ if the IRR is, for example, 5% or 15%?

Figure: Calculating CF0 for IRR = 5% and 15%.{class=pp-figure}

![](../images/info-irr-calculations.svg)

If IRR = 15% then the combined future cashflows are worth 159.16 EUR in `2021-01-15`. So, you need less money (than 170 EUR) to get the same financial results.  The real IRR should be somewhat lower. With 5% however, you need 194.64 EUR to get the same total cashflows in 2021. After some guesswork and interpolation, you arrive at the exact IRR of <span style="color:red">**11.61%**</span>, which will precisely bring all future cash flows to the initial investment of 170 EUR.

In the previous example, the dividends are immediately "consumed": you got yourself a nice meal from it. In another scenario, you keep the dividends in your drawer - or in PP terminology: a deposit account -  until `2023-06-15` and cash them in at the same moment you sell the share. In that case, there are only two cashflows: $CF_{t0}$ = 170 EUR and $CF_{t881}$ = 15 + 17 +185 EUR.

Equation (1) has only two terms and could be solved for IRR rather easily.

**Eq (2)**    $CF_{t0} = \frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\frac{t_1}{365}} \implies  IRR = \sqrt[\frac{t_1}{365}]{\frac{CF_{t1}}{CF_{t0}}}-1$

In this case, your initial investment of 170 EUR has an IRR = $\sqrt[\frac{881}{365}]{\frac{217}{170}}-1$ = <span style="color:red">**10.64%**</span>. Why is this IRR smaller than the previous one? Because you kept the dividend until a later date, the 15 EUR in `2021-09-15` is less worth in `2023-06-15`.

PP calculates three variants of IRR.

  + **Performance IRR**: this is the IRR for the whole project and a specific reporting period; see `side bar > Reports > Performance`.

  + **Security IRR**: the IRR of a selected security for a specific reporting period; see `sidebar > Reports > Performance > Securities`.

  + **Trade IRR**: the IRR of a buy-sell cycle of a selected security. See `sidebar > Reports > Performance > Trades`

The Performance and Security IRR are calculated for a specific [reporting period](./reporting-period.md); e.g. 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, custom period. It is very important to distinguish the following cases:

  + $t_0$ occurs before the start of the reporting period $RP_{start}$.  PP can calculate the value of $CF_0$ (through historic quotes or transaction price) at $RP_{start}$. The holding period is calculated from $RP_{start}$ for each CF.

  + $t_0$ occurs after $RP_{start}$ but before $RP_{end}$. The value of $CF_0$ is known. The holding period is calculated from $RP_{start}$.

  + $t_n$ falls after $RP_{end}$. All transactions after $RP_{end}$ do not contribute to the calculation of IRR for that reporting period.
