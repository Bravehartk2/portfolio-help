title: Benchmarking your portfolio
---
Benchmarking your portfolio performance against financial indexes is a common practice in investment management. This process involves comparing the returns of your portfolio or individual securities to the returns of a selected benchmark index.

A stock index is a measure of the value of a hypothetical portfolio of investment holdings that represents a segment of the financial market. For example, [Standard & Poorâ€™s
500](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview) index measures the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means that the influence of each company in the index is proportional to its market capitalization. On March 8, 2024, the S&P 500 Index stood at 5,123.69 USD.

## Finding an index

A list of major indexes can be found on several financial websites such as [investing.com](https://www.investing.com/indices/major-indices) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/world-indices/). In order to use an index for benchmarking your portfolio, you need to add it as a security.

For the indexes listed on Yahoo Finance, simply [add a new security](../getting-started/adding-securities.md) and search for the ticker symbol; e.g. ^GSPC. If you want to use the data from investing.com, you have to download the historical prices. Select the correct time period and click the download button to receive a CSV-file (you need a free registration for that). Create a new empty instrument. See the section [File > Import](../reference/file/import.md#csv-files-comma-separated-values) and [How-to > Downloading Historical Prices](./downloading-historical-prices/csv-file.md#investingcom) for a detailed explanation how to import these historical prices. For appending the future daily prices, you can use the daily updated table from the last month. Set the Quote Feed of the Historical Quotes to `Table on website` and use the following Feed URL: https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-historical-data. This Quote Feed will not overwrite the existing prices but will append new ones.

There are plenty of mutual funds or ETF's that replicate an index. For example, both [Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vfiax#portfolio-composition) and the [iShares Core S&P 500 ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239726/ishares-core-sp-500-etf) replicate the S&P 500 quite narrowly. So, you could use also one these funds as benchmark.

As depicted in Figure 1, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF closely mirrors the S&P index. The Vanguard index fund also follows the trend closely but exhibits some deviations.

## Displaying the benchmark

To display a graph similar to Figure 1, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the menu `View > Reports > Performance > Chart`.
2. Utilize the `Configure Chart` icon, represented by a gear symbol, located in the top right corner of the screen.
3. Within the configuration options, you can add or remove `time series` and `benchmarks`.
4. It's important to note that securities must have a market value, meaning they have been purchased, in order to be used as a time series. Benchmarks only require historical prices. Since we cannot buy stock of an index, we need to use the benchmark option for it.

Please take note that the historical prices for the displayed securities differ notably: roughly 5000 USD for the S&P index, and approximately 500 USD for both the iShares ETF and Vanguard index fund. Despite this discrepancy, the curves overlap, indicating that the vertical value axis of the graph is represented in percentages (not USD). This percentage is calculated from the initial historical price of March 10, 2014 for each benchmark separately.
