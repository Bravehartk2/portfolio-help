title: Reconstructing the sample-portfolio.xml file
---
In order to reconstruct the sample-portfolio.xml file, you first need to create a new portfolio with the menu `File > New > File` (see [Getting Started](../getting-started/create-portfolio.md)). Choose your base currency. Set it to EUR if you want to follow the sample portfolio. Add a security account (e.g. `Stocks`) and a reference deposit account (e.g. `EUR-account`). Finish the wizard. Add more security and deposit accounts.

The sample portfolio contains the following security accounts: `Stocks`, `Bonds`, `Funds`, `Crypto`, and `Gold`. They all have the same `EUR-account` as reference.

The sample portfolio contains the following deposit accounts: `EUR-account`, `USD-account`, `GBP-account`, `JPY-acount`, `ZAR-account`... [*The choice of multiple currency accounts should emphasis the international character/open mindedness of the software*]

In the `All Securities` view, add your securities. The sample portfolio contains the following securities.

**Gold & other precious metals**

    - Gold: [see how-to > Retrieving gold and other precious metals prices](./gold-prices.md) to create a security that can hold Degussa 30 oz gold bars.
    - other metal: ??

**Bonds**
    - Government: e.g. Germany 10Y YTM (Bund)Germany 10 Year bond
    - Corporate bond: e.g. Rolls-Royce, 5.75% 15oct2027, GBP (XS2244321787)
    - do we place here also "iShares Core Euro Government Bond UCITS ETF (Dist)" or does it belong with "funds"?

**Crypto**
    - see existing kommer.xml : Bitcoin BTC
    - other: ?

**Funds**
    - some ETF from kommer.xml (but there are too many?): I should keep: iShares Core Euro Government Bond UCITS ETF (Dist) (see above) and iShares MSCI EM UCITS ETF (Dist) (because our stock from EM is probably limited)
    - I should add: iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (to illustrate the S&P 500 index) or an ETF that replicates the MSCI world or all countries. 

**Stock**
    
    - [Stock should be spread over countries and sectors from GICS]. For example:

    1. Energy: Royal Dutch Shell (Netherlands/GB)
    2. Materials: Rio Tinto (GB/Australia) [also choice dividend]
    3. Industrials: Bombardier Inc (Canada)
    4. Consumer Discretionary: Daimler AG (Germany) [also spin-off Mercedes ...] & Amazon (USA) [also split]
    5. Consumer Staples: The Procter & Gamble Company (United States)
    6. Health Care: Novartis AG (Switzerland)
    7. Financials: HSBC Holdings plc (United Kingdom)
    8. Information Technology: Sony (Japan)
    9. Telecommunication Services: Deutsche telekom (Germany)
    10. Utilities: Engie SA (France)
    11. Real Estate: Mariott International (United States)

For each security, info should be provide such as ticker, taxonomy, historical prices download instructions.

## Portfolio transactions

For each of the above securities, at least one buy or inbound delivery transaction should be made.  Other transactions (sell, dividend, ...) should also be present.
