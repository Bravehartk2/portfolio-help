# About this Manual

Since 2012, [Portfolio Performance](https://portfolio-performance.info) is tracking the overall performance of portfolios - across different accounts - using True-Time Weighted Rate of Return and Internal Rate of Return.

*Portfolio Performance* (PP) itself tries to stay as simple and intuitive as it can. But without explanations it is not always possible - many similar questions in the [Forum](https://forum.portfolio-performance.info) show that. This manual is meant to guide you through your first steps with PP, explain basic concepts and document the features that need to be explained.

## What is Portfolio Performance?

*Portfolio Performance* is a simple and powerful tool for maintaining your securities portfolio. With *Portfolio Performance* you can 

- track the composition and development of your securities portfolio with meaningful overviews, key figures and charts
- track the historical price development of securities and your purchases and sales  
- classify the securities in your portfolio according to your needs and visualize the composition, e.g. by asset classes and regions
- define and track the portfolio strategy with your planned asset allocation and ensure it in the rebalancing process
- create an overarching view across multiple securities accounts and clearing accounts
- import statements from online banks and brokers quickly and conveniently

## Why another tool, there is Excel?

Simple calculations with Excel or from online banking provide incorrect results if they are based only on absolute figures at the beginning and end of an observation period and do not properly include purchases and sales: A purchase increases the value of the portfolio, but is not a return. 

*Portfolio Performance* calculates the performance in a financially correct way using True-Time Weighted Rate of Return and Internal Rate of Return, taking into account the purchases and sales at the respective execution date. 

## First steps with Portfolio Performance

In order to be able to track, evaluate and manage your securities portfolio with *Portfolio Performance*, *Portfolio Performance* needs the basic data about your portfolio and past transactions. After that, you can immediately make your first evaluations and analyze your portfolio and its performance from different angles.  

### Create portfolio file

- You create a new portfolio file and set up your [accounts](accounts.md). The portfolio file contains all of these accounts but also all of your transactions, classifications, etc.

### Create securities  

- you create the securities you are interested in in the securities list 
- Master data and historical price can be updated by *Portfolio Performance* automatically

### Build up portfolios

- you fill the securities account and clearing account with holdings and/or historical transactions for the first time

### Retrieve asset statement and performance reports

- What is the composition of your portfolio? The statement of assets shows the composition of the portfolio as a list, in historical performance and as a pie chart
- What is the current performance of your portfolio? In addition to evaluations of return and volatility, you receive an overview of the taxes and costs incurred

### Perform classification of asset shares

- With your own, self-selected structure, you display the weighting of the asset shares, e.g. by region and/or asset class

### Define portfolio strategy and perform rebalancing

- you map your own portfolio strategy with target values for different share classes 
- you can make a target/actual comparison and perform rebalancing 

### Keep the portfolio up to date

- you post new purchases, sales and dividends as well as costs and taxes incurred. This can be done quickly and easily by importing the PDF statements from the bank, or manually
