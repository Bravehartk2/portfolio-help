- [Basic concepts](concepts/index.md): Although PP is a very intuitive and easy to use program, the underlying (financial) concepts are not.

# About Portfolio Performance

PP is an Eclipse-based desktop application written in Java. The open-source project began in 2012 and has since been [updated](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/releases) numerous times. With PP you can: 

- track the composition and development of your securities portfolio with meaningful overviews, key figures and charts
- track the historical price development of securities and your purchases and sales  
- classify the securities in your portfolio according to your needs and visualize the composition, e.g. by asset classes and regions
- define and track the portfolio strategy with your planned asset allocation and ensure it in the rebalancing process
- create an overview across multiple securities accounts and clearing accounts
- import statements from online banks and brokers quickly and conveniently

Why yet another application? With Excel you can simulate some of these calculations. Or your broker can provide you with some info. Most of the time, however, they provide incorrect results. They are based only on absolute figures at the beginning and end of a reporting period and do not properly include purchases and sales or variable reporting periods. PP calculates the performance in a financially correct way using True-Time Weighted Rate of Return and Internal Rate of Return, taking into account the purchases and sales at their respective execution date.
