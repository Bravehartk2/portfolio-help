Naturally, the performance of your portfolio is a primary focus in PP, hence the name of the software. The key performance indicators are summarized in the dashboard, which can be accessed through the menu `View > Reports > Performance` or with the sidebar (see figure 1).

By default, this dashboard contains three widgets (panels): `Key Indicators`, `Risk Indicators`, and `Calculation`. Right mouse click on an empty space of the canvas lets you add more widgets (see later).

!!! note
	The key and risk indicators consider all accounts in the calculation by default. However, you can narrow down the calculation to specific accounts or securities by right-clicking the indicator label and choosing a different data series.
