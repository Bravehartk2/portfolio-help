You can either use one of the precompiled installation files or compile the complete application by yourself. The application is available for MacOS, Windows and Linux.

What is the current performance of your portfolio? Along with assessments of returns and volatility, you will also receive an overview of the taxes and costs associated with it.

You map your own portfolio strategy with target values for different share classes.
You can make a target/actual comparison and perform a rebalancing
