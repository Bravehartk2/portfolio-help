Immediately after the previous "Create portfolio" step, your portfolio main screen looks a bit empty (see figure 1). A list of all securities could me shown with the `All Securities` item from the left sidebar. Right now, it's still empty.

 With the `Add new investment instrment` button, you can start adding securities in your portfolio. As you can see from figure 1, you can add new instruments (shares, bonds, ...), new Cryptocurrencies, new exchange rates. There is also a possibility to import securities from a CSV-file or to create a new (not existing) security.

 More options are available through the menu `File > New` (see figure 1).

 # Adding new instruments

 Selecting the New > Security (menu) or New instrument ... (button) option will display the following window (see figure 2).
