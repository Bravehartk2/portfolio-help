PP is available for MacOS, Windows and Linux. You need to download it and do some installation steps. After the first installation, the program will check on each start-up for new updates and install these automatically (see figure 1).

   + Windows: you can download the compressed Zip-file and extract it in a directory at your choice. Even an USB-stick (about 250 MB free space) is fine (run from stick). You can also download the installer file (setup.exe). On Windows 11, you get a security warning about the dangers to run a exe-file. Double clicking on this file, will start the installation. You need about 200 MB of free space.
