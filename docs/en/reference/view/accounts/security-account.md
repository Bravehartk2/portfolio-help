# View &rsaquo; Accounts &rsaquo; Securities Accounts

The `Securities Accounts` view presents a list of all security accounts in the main pane. For each account, the total market value of its asssets is displayed as `Volume of security deposits`. The user interface (UI) of the main pane resembles that of the [Deposit Account](./deposit-account.md).

A security account will hold your securities and will be used for buying or selling securities. A securities account is most often named after the broker or bank that you use for buying or selling. But other variants are possible. For example, you could collect all your bitcoin investments into a separate account `crypto`. 

Note that although `broker-1` has two deposit accounts (see [figure 1](images/sb-accounts-deposit-accounts.png) of Deposit Account), only one of them `broker-1 (EUR)` is set as the reference account. The bottom panel shows the purchase transaction with the `Broker-1`account.

The information pane features two tabs. The `Statement of Assets` tab, depicted in Figure 1, comprises a list of all assets in the account. It includes details such as the number of shares, the name and symbol of the asset, the latest price, the total market value (computed as shares multiplied by Quote), and the percentage of the asset in the total portfolio.

With the `Show or hide columns` icon (gear), you can add numerous other fields such as purchase price, dividends, and many more. These fields are described in full detail in [View > Reports > Statement of Assets](../reports/statement/index.md#available-columns). The Export Data as CSV icon will save this table as a CSV-file.

The gear icon will let you add a few more fields such as `ISIN`, `Symbol`, and `WKN`. The export button will save the displayed table as CSV-file.
