# Basic Concepts

In this chapter, you'll find a concise yet clear explanation of several fundamental concepts crucial for understanding portfolio performance. It's essential to grasp these concepts to avoid miscalculations or misinterpretations of the numbers.

- [Financial Terminology](financial-terminology.md): Understanding basic financial terminology is crucial for optimal use of PP and this manual. This page contains links to excellent resources.
- [Account](account.md): An account in PP can take various forms: Securities, Deposit, Reference, Cash, Offset, etc. Learn what these terms mean and how they differ.
- [Transaction](transaction.md): A financial transaction is an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. In the case of PP, transactions involve securities. There are security transactions such as buy, sell delivery (inbound), and delivery (outbound); deposit transactions such as deposit, removal, interest, interest charge, fees, fees refund, taxes, and tax refund; and dividend transactions.
- [Reporting Period](reporting-period.md): The (reporting) period is the time frame considered for reporting (calculations, graphs, statistics). It's crucial to realize that every performance calculation considers a reporting period, even if not explicitly set.
- [Purchase Value](purchase-value.md): The Purchase Value of a security is the total value of each buy (+) and sell (-) transaction for that security, factoring in the reporting period. The transaction value includes taxes and fees and is sometimes referred to as "Net Transaction Value."
- [Internal Rate of Return (IRR)](irr-theory.md): IRR measures the performance of an investment between two dates. It's expressed as an annual interest rate required to bring the initial value of the investment at time \\(t_{0}\\) to the final value at time \\(t_{n}\\).
- [Extensive Simplified Example](irr-example.md): Explore a comprehensive yet simplified example covering different IRR calculations, including trade, security, and performance for various reporting periods (1, 2, and 3 years).
