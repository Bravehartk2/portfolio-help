Portfolio performance is all about numbers. It is easy to completely miscalculate or misinterpret these numbers, if you don't understand the underlying assumptions.</p> <ul> <li>Account: An account is a collection of transactions. PP uses several terms to indicate the concept of account: Securities, Deposit, Reference, Cash, Offset, ... account. What do they mean and in what aspects do they differ?</li> <li>Transaction: A financial transaction is an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. In case of PP, the exchange is about securities. There are security transactions such as buy, sell delivery (inbound), and delivery (outbound); deposit transactions such as deposit, removal, interest, interest charge, fees, fees refund, taxes, tax refund; and dividend transactions.</li> <li>Reporting period: The (reporting) period is the time slice that is taken into account for reporting (calculations, graphs, statistics). It's very important that you realize that for every performance calculation a reporting period is taken into account, even if you haven't set one explicitly.</li> <li>Purchase value: The Purchase Value of a security is the summed\u00a0value\u00a0of each buy (+) and sell (-) transaction of that security, taken into account the reporting period. The value of a transaction includes the taxes and fees; sometimes also called \u201cNet Transaction Value\u201d.</li> <li>Internal Rate of Return (IRR): The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) measures the performance of an investment between two dates.

They are used for deposits and withdrawals in EUR and USD respectively. It's a bit redundant to call them \u201cEUR\u201d and \u201cUSD\u201d because you also need to specify the currency that the account will use (see third column in figure). For example, if you want to book a dividend in EUR, you will see the following dialog box (see fig 2). The cash account can be selected from a drop-down list and the correct currency will be automatically.</p> <p> Figure 2: Deposit Account with redundant Currency. </p> <p>You can use other names depending on your needs. For example, if you want to keep all your dividends or taxes in a separate account, you could name it \u201cDividends\u201d and \u201cTaxes\u201d in stead of EUR and USD. Of course, you will also need to decide which currency that will be used for them. And, if you receive dividends in both EUR and USD then you need two deposit accounts with the name \u201cDividends\u201d but with different currencies.</p> <p>Another possibility is to name the deposit accounts with the name of the bank or broker they belong to; e.g. BNPPF, Deutsche Bank, \u2026</p> <p>A deposit account is used to transfer or receive money as the result of a transaction.

It is expressed as an annual interest rate that is necessary to bring the initial value of the investment at time $t_{0}$ to the final value at time $t_{n}$. In PP, the reporting period is measured in days. The IRR can apply for a specific security or trade or the whole portfolio. The classic equation to explain the meaning of IRR is:</p> <p>Eq (1)    $CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}}+\\frac{CF_{t2}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_2}{365}}+...+ \\frac{CF_{tn}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_n}{365}}$</p> <p>$CF_{t0}$ is the initial cashflow at time $t_0$. It is the sum of all in- and outflows at that moment in time and represents your initial investment. $CF_{t1}$, $CF_{tn}$ are the -hopefully positive- net cashflows that your initial investment will yield. PP works with periods of 1 day instead of the classical periods of 1 year. Therefore $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_n$ should be converted to the number of days between $t_0$ and $t_n$. Of course, if the period between $t_0$ and $t_n$ is  for example 365 days, the exponent becomes 1. Eq (1) is a direct derivation from the classic formula of present value.</p> <p>A simple example. There is also a IRR Practical example step-by-step, solved in PP. On 2021-01-15 you have bought 10 shares at 17 EUR. Now (2023-06-15) the price has increased to 18.5 EUR. Meanwhile, you have received a dividend of 1.5 EUR/share on 2021-09-10 and a second dividend of 1.7 EUR/share on 2022-09-10. What is the performance or IRR of this security?

Or 15%?</p> <p> Fig 1: Calculating IRR </p> <p>If IRR = 15% then the combined future cashflows are worth 159.16 EUR in 2021-01-15. So, you need less money (than 170 EUR) to get the same financial results.  So, the real IRR should be somewhat lower. With 5% however, you need in 2021 about 194.64 EUR to get the same total cashflows. After some guesswork and interpolation you get at the exact IRR = 11.61% that will bring all future cashflow to the precise initial investment of 170 EUR.</p> <p>In the previous example, the dividends are immediately \"consumed\" (you got yourself a nice meal from it). In another scenario, you keep the dividends in your drawer until 2023-06-15 and cash them in at the same moment you sell the share. In that case, there are only two cashflows: $CF_{t0}$ = 170 EUR and $CF_{t881}$ = 15 + 17 +185 EUR.</p> <p>Equation (1) has only two terms and could be solved for IRR rather easily.</p> <p>Eq (2)    $CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}} \\implies  IRR = \\sqrt[\\frac{t_1}{365}]{\\frac{CF_{t1}}{CF_{t0}}}-1$</p> <p>In this case, your initial investment of 170 EUR has an IRR = $\\sqrt[\\frac{881}{365}]{\\frac{217}{170}}-1$ = 10.64%. Why is this IRR smaller than the previous one?

Because all purchases fall before the reporting period, the value for each of them is taken from the beginning of the period. At that time (2022, May 15), the share was valued at a quote of 110 EUR (see graph). So, the total purchase value is 30 shares * 110 = 3300 EUR.

Since, there are no purchases afterwards, this amount is also the purchase value of the 1 year period.</p> <p>The 2 years period starts at 2021, May 15. Only the third buy falls within the period. So, buy 1 and buy 2 are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (= 90 EUR). So, the Statement of Assets equals 1350 EUR. There is one buy afterwards (valued at the buying quote).

You can enter this in the next step of the wizard or you can specify it in the CSV-file.</p> <p>Let's take a simplified example (EUR-dividend in a EUR-cash account; see figure 7). The minimal info to register this dividend is:</p> <pre><code>type, Date, ISIN, Value\ndividend, 2022-01-01, BE0974258874, 40\n</code></pre> <pre><code>+ This will result in the following \"dividend\" transaction.\n</code></pre> <p> Fig 7: Simplified buying transaction example for import </p> <p>Adding Fees and Taxes will calculate the Gross Amount. You cannot specify the Gross Amount in itself. Adding the number of Shares will calculate the dividend payment/share. It is also not possible to specify this in itself. So, a typical CSV-file for a dividend payment in the currency of the Cash account will look like:</p> <pre><code>Type, Date, ISIN, Value, fees, taxes, shares\ndividend, 2022-01-01, BE0974258874, 200, 3, 2, 25\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tricks/","title":"Tips & tricks","text":"<p>PP is a very powerful and - most of time - intuitive program.

With some magic, you can download historical data for specific funds from this website.</p> <p>First go to the Chart page for the fund (or trust or EFT) on the Morningstar website; e.g. https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/. I will use the Baillie Gifford Positive Change Fund B Accumulation fund (ISIN GB00BYVGKV59) as an example.</p> <p>Remove any other benchmarks etc the are charted (this is not necessary, but makes things easier). Open your browser's \"developer tools\" which is F12 in Firefox &amp; Edge and probably other browsers as well. Go to the \"Network\" tab and press the clear button which looks like a bin; again, not necessary but makes things easier. Now press the \"chart settings\" button just above the chart, click \"display options\", and then click the \"percentage\" button - this switches the chart to show the actual fund price, rather than a percentage change, and handily for our purposes causes the Morningstar website to request a link that we can use in Portfolio Performance with a bit of modification. That link should display in the \"network\" screen of the browser's developer tools, so now right click on the entry that comes from the \"tools.morningstar.co.uk 44\" domain and is of type \"json\" and select the Copy-&gt;Copy URL option. The link should be</p> <p><pre><code>https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/api/rest.svc/timeseries_price/\nt92wz0sj7c?currencyId=GBP&amp;idtype=Morningstar&amp;frequency=daily&amp;\nstartDate=2011-02-01&amp;priceType=&amp;outputType=COMPACTJSON&amp;\nid=F00000ZB0M]2]0]FOGBR$$ALL&amp;applyTrackRecordExtension=true\n</code></pre> You now need to change some of the options in the link and slightly simplify it as well so it becomes:</p> <pre><code>https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/api/rest.svc/timeseries_price/\nt92wz0sj7c?currencyId=GBP&amp;idtype=Morningstar&amp;frequency=daily&amp;\noutputType=JSON&amp;startDate=2020-12-31&amp;id=F00000ZB0M]2]0]\nFOGBR$$ALL\n</code></pre> <p>You can go to this link in your browser if you want to see the data. There are 4 options worth highlighting: frequency which will give you daily prices, outputType gives you a style of JSON that Portfolio Performance can parse, startDate lets you choose how far back to go, and id is the Morningstar reference for the security - so change that value for any other ones you want to use. The order of the options doesn't matter, but I find it easier to put the id at the end for when I'm setting up multiple securities.</p> <p>Now in Portfolio Performance select JSON as the provider in the \"Historical Quotes\" tab of the security, and use the following values (see also figure 1):</p> <pre><code>Feed URL = the link just created\nPath to Date = $.TimeSeries.Security[*].HistoryDetail[*].EndDate\nPath to Close = $.TimeSeries.Security[*].HistoryDetail[*].Value\n</code></pre> <p> Fig 1: Example of JSON provider for historical quotes </p> <p>Always worth double checking the displayed values against the Morningstar chart.</p>"}]}
