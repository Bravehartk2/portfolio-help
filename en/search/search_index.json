Below is an alphabetical list containing descriptions of all attributes, also referred to as fields or columns, used in various sections within PP.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Actual # quotes: the number of quotes in the historic prices list of a security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Change in Price (period): the difference in historic quotes between the last and first quote of a specified time span, expressed as a percentage. The period may be denoted in years (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, 3 years) or as a date range (From yyyy-mm-dd to yyyy-mm-dd). If the duration is in years, the last date is today, and the first date is today minus x years.</p> </li> <li> <p>Change on Previous Day (amount) or \u0394 amount: the absolute difference between the latest retrieved quote and the previous one (which is most likely the quote from the previous day).</p> </li> <li> <p>Change on Previous Day (%) or \u0394 %: the difference between the latest retrieved quote and the previous one (which is most likely the quote from the previous day), expressed as a percentage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Completeness of historic quotes: the ratio between the actual and expected number of historic quotes of a security, expressed as a percentage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Currency: the currency for a security chosen at its creation, which becomes immutable after the initial transaction involving this security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Date of first historical quote: The first date for which you have historical prices of a security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Date of last historical quote: The last date for which you have historical prices of the security. It's important to note that having these dates does not necessarily mean you have all intermediate historical prices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Date of latest quote: the most recent date on which the current market value or price of a financial instrument, such as a stock, bond, or commodity, was publicly provided or updated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distance to SMA (days): a metric that measures the difference between the current price (quote) of a share and the average price of that share over a specified number of past days (5, 20, 30, 38, 50, 90, 100, or 200 days), expressed as a percentage. The acronym \"SMA\" stands for \"Simple Moving Average\". For example, the average price of security for the last 5 daily quotes is (100 + 98 + 99 + 97 + 96)/5 = 98. The Distance to SMA (5 days) is (100-98)/98 = 2.04%.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Distance to ATH (period): a metric that shows how far the current price is from the highest price in the specified period (1 year, 2 years, 3 years or a date range From yyyy-mm-dd to yyyy-mm-dd). For example, the highest price of a security in the last year was 77.4 EUR. The current price is 71.96 EUR. So the Distance to ATH for a 1 year period is equal to (71.96 - 77.4)/77.4 or -7.03%.</p> </li> <li> <p>Exchange: a security may be traded on more than one exchange. For example, the NVIDIA stock is traded on Nasdaq (symbol NVDA, exchange NMS) or XETRA (symbol NVD.DE, exchange GER), and many more exchanges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expected # quotes: given the nature and frequency of a security and the calendar in use, PP calculates the expected number of quotes for the time period between the Date of last and first historical quote.

Example of Deposit Accounts. </p> <p>In Figure 1 (top panel), there are three deposit accounts named <code>Broker-1 (EUR)</code>, <code>Broker-1 (USD)</code>, and <code>broker-2 (EUR)</code>. Notice the column heading \"Cash Account\". The bottom panel shows the transactions of the selected Deposit Account <code>Broker-1 (EUR)</code>.</p> <p>Deposit Accounts are used for deposits and withdrawals in EUR and USD in the two broker accounts. It's somewhat redundant to add \"EUR\" and \"USD\" in the name because you also need to specify the currency for each deposit account (see the third column in Figure 1). On the other hand, in many dialogs (for example when buying a security) you need to specify the deposit account. The added currency in the name of the deposit account will help you then choosing the correct one.</p> <p>Of course, you can use other names depending on your needs. For example, if you want to keep all your dividends and taxes in a separate account, you could name it <code>Dividends</code> and <code>Taxes</code>. If you receive dividends in both EUR and USD, then you need also two deposit accounts with the name <code>Dividends</code> but with different currencies.</p> <p>A deposit account is used to transfer or receive money as the result of a transaction. In Figure 1, the balance of <code>Broker-1 (EUR)</code> reflects the deposit of 3000 EUR and the purchase of each 2969.12 EUR. A deposit account can be negative.

These exchange rates are retrieved from The European Central Bank (ECB) and go back until the year 1999 when the EUR was introduced on the financial markets. They are in fact reference rates and will probably differ slightly from the real transaction rates that your broker or bank will use.</p> <p>Securities are traded on exchange markets such as NADAQ or XETRA, where buyers and sellers agree on a price. Historical quotes are the prices of securities at different points in time. The <code>Close</code> price is the last price of the security at the end of the trading day. Other types are the <code>Open</code> quote, the first price of the security at the start of the trading day, the <code>Low</code> and <code>High</code>quotes, which are the lowest and highest price of the security during the trading day. The <code>Latest</code> quote is the most recent price of the security available from the exchange market. The latest quote may not be the same as the close price.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>PP uses the <code>Close</code> quote in its performance calculations. If there is a Latest quote available, it will be integrated in the Close price. For Bitcoins, the situation is more complex because they are traded 24/24. PP uses midnight (on the users system) to set the Close Quote. So, the historical quotes of a bitcoin could vary between users.</p> <p>Sometimes, the historical quotes are adjusted to reflect certain events that affect the value of the security, such as stock splits, dividends, or mergers. These are called the <code>Adjusted close</code> quotes. They are useful for comparing the long-term performance of the security, as they account for the changes in the number of shares or the amount of cash paid to the shareholders.</p> <p>There isn't a shortage of financial services that publish historical prices. However, most of them are rather expensive. Many also offer a so-called free account, but as the saying goes, \"if it is free, you are the customer.\" Finding good (precise, up-to-date) but free data sources for all your historical prices can be challenging. PP suggests, among others, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, Quandl, which were once excellent solutions but have since changed their offerings and are not as useful anymore as free services. Their terms of use and, most importantly, their commitment in the long run often fall short. In practice, only Portfolio Report and Yahoo Finance could be recommended for now. But see the how-to section for some tips &amp; tricks.</p> <p>Exchange markets (must) publish the historical quotes of the securities they trade. Several financial services such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and others provide historical quotes for different securities and exchange markets through their websites.</p> <p>There are two primary methods for obtaining financial data from the web: downloading a csv file, or using an API (Application Programming Interface) to get the data.</p> <p>Both methods start with a request to the financial service or website. A request is a message that contains the information and parameters needed to access the historical quote feed. A request is sent from the client, which is the user's device or application, to the server, which is the financial service or website. The server processes the request and sends back a response. The response could be a csv file, or a structured text (JSON or XML).</p> <p>In both cases, PP needs to map its internal fields, such as date and value of the quote, with the data in the response. If successfully, PP can use these fields then in its performance calculation.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In theory, one could scrape webpages that contain tables with historical prices (see for example, Figure 1). PP supports this method; see Import HTML table. However, in practice, nowadays most service providers utilize JavaScript or another technology that hinders this scraping process.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/purchase-value/","title":"Purchase Value","text":"<p>The Purchase Value of a security is the summed\u00a0value\u00a0of each buy (+) and sell (-) transaction of that security, taken into account the reporting period.

If the purchase date lies within the period, then the value at the purchase date is used. However, if the purchase data is later than the end of the reporting period, then the purchase is not taken into account for the calculation of the purchase value. Purchase Value and Purchase Price are used in Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Securities (see figure 1)</p> <p>Figure 1.  Purchase value of a security</p> <p>Assume the following scenario. We are now 2023, May, 15th and you have bought 30 shares at different times and quotes (see figure 2). An overview of all buys and their respective quotes is shown in figure.</p> <p>Figure 2.  List of Buy transactions of security example</p> <p>The reported purchase value of a particular security is dependent upon the selected reporting period. In the Table 1, you can see that the purchase value of this simple transaction, can vary between 3300 EUR and 500 EUR, depending on the selected period.</p> Table 1: Three reporting periods based on the current day (2023-05-15) Period From \u2026 to \u2026 Purchase Value 1 year 2022, May 15 - 2023, May 15 3300 EUR 2 years 2021, May 15 - 2023, May 15 3000 EUR 3 years 2020, May 15 - 2023, May 15 3050 EUR Custom 2000, Jan 1 - 2020, Jan 01 500 EUR <p>The 1 year period starts at 2022, May 15 and ends today (2023,May 15); sometimes also called YTD (Year To Date). Because all purchases fall before the reporting period, the value for each of them is taken from the beginning of the period. At that time (2022, May 15), the share was valued at a quote of 110 EUR (see graph). So, the total purchase value is 30 shares * 110 = 3300 EUR. This is the beginning situation of the period (also called Statement of Assets). Since, there are no purchases afterwards, this amount is also the purchase value of the 1 year period.</p> <p>The 2 years period starts at 2021, May 15. Only the third buy falls within the period. So, buy 1 and buy 2 are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (= 90 EUR). So, the Statement of Assets equals 1350 EUR. There is one buy afterwards (valued at the buying quote). The total Purchase Value of this 2 year period is therefore (5 + 10) shares at 90 EUR + 15 shares at 110 EUR or 1350 +1650 = 3000 EUR.</p> <p>The 3 years period start at 2020, May 15. The second and third buy lie within the reporting period and are evaluated at their respective quotes: 10 shares at 90 EUR (= 900 EUR) and 15 shares at 110 EUR (= 1650 EUR). The beginning of the period or Statement of Assets is the result of the first buy (2020, Jan 1) takes the quote from the beginning of the period (2020, May 15) which is the same as the purchase quote (e.g. 100 EUR); resulting in a purchase of 5 * 100 EUR = 500 EUR.</p> <p>The previous explanation can be seen in the pop-over, when hovering the mouse over the Purchase Value (see Figure 3).</p> <p>Figure 3.  Pop-over panel for Purchase value field.</p> <p>The custom period (from 2000, Jan 1 (not included) until 2020, Jan 1 (included) has a Purchase Value of 500 EUR because it contains only the first buy (= 5 * 100 EUR). The second and third buy or not taken into account because they occur later than the period end. Things become more complicated -but with the same logic- when there are also sell transactions. Important to remember is that PP use a FIFO (First In, First OUT) method to calculate the result of a sell transaction. Suppose that you did a (rather bad timed) sell at 2021, Jul 1 2020 of 12 shares (see Figure 4).</p> <p>Figure 4.  Overview and graph of all buy and sell transactions.</p> <p>At that moment there were 15 shares available (5 at 100 EUR and 10 at 90 EUR). Selling 12 of them will first sell the 5 shares of 100 EUR and then another 2 of 90 EUR, leaving 3 shares of 90 EUR available.</p> <p>Now, let's calculate the Purchase Value for the different periods.</p> <ul> <li> <p>1 year period: The period runs from 2022, May 15 until 2023, May 15. All purchases are done before the beginning of the period; so each of them is valued at the price of 2022, May 15, which is 110 EUR. How many shares are available? 5 + 10 - 12 + 15 = 18 at 110 EUR or 1980 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>2 years period running from 2021, May 15 until 2023, May 15. Only the last buy transaction falls within the period and is evaluated at its current quote (110 EUR). The Statement of Assets consists of 3 shares (15 buy - 12 sell). They are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (90 EUR). The Purchase Value for the 2 years period is: 3 * 90 EUR + 15 * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>3 years period running from 2020, May 15 until 2023, May 15. The Statement of Assets is 0 EUR because all 5 shares from buy 1 are sold (FIFO) on 2021, Jul 15. From the second buy, only 3 shares are remaining, evaluated at 90 EUR. The third buy is evaluated at 110 EUR. The Purchase Value of the 3 years period is 3 shares * 90 EUR + 15 shares * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.

It also differentiates between measuring performance on the portfolio, security, or trade level.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The simple Rate of Return (ROR) isn't adequate for describing the performance of a portfolio when transactions occur in the reporting period. For instance, suppose your portfolio already contains one share valued at 100 EUR at the beginning of the year (MVB=100); an empty portfolio would pose even more problems due to dividing by zero in Equation 1. Thanks to the favorable  track record of the company issuing the share, its price increases to 104 EUR per share at the end of the year. Let's now compare the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>No additional transactions: you do nothing. According to Equation 1, r = (104-100)/100 = 4%. This seems intuitive correct. You gained 4 EUR, which is 4% of the initial value.</li> <li>Additional transactions: you acquire  a second share at 100 EUR; right at the beginning of the year. MVB is still 100 EUR; while MVE becomes 2 * 104 = 208 EUR. The performance becomes a staggering 108% or (208-100)/100. This does not feel OK. You know that the growth rate of the company's share is 4%. Certainly, your total investment of 200\u20ac has gained 8 EUR or 4% on 200 EUR; but not on the MVB of 100 EUR.

A cash flow is any amount of money that is added to or withdrawn from a portfolio. The base formula for the IRR calculation is:</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{MVE = MVB \\times (1 + IRR)^{\\frac{RD_1}{365}} + \\sum_{t=1} ^{n}CF_t \\times (1+IRR)^{\\frac{RD_t}{365}} \\qquad \\text{(Eq 1)}}$$</p> <p>where n = the number of cash flows in the reporting period, $CF_t$ = cash flow at time t within the period, and $RD_t$ = the number of remaining days within the period.

To calculate the periodic return rate, divide by the number of days of the period. For example</p> <p>The formula is very similar to the calculation of Future Value. With an interest rate of 5%, 100 EUR today will be worth 115.76 EUR in three years or <code>100 x (1 +0.05)^3</code>. Since PP uses days as standard period, we need to divide the remaining number of days that the cash flow could influence the performance by 365 to obtain a decimal representation of the yearly period. $\\mathrm{CF_t \\times (1+IRR)^{\\frac{RD_t}{365}}}$ is thus the expected future value of the cash flow CF at time t by the the end of the period with an annual interest rate = IRR. Please note that in the absence of any cash flows, Equation 1 resembles the simple return formula MVE = MVB x (1 + r).</p> <p>The IRR is the annual interest rate that is necessary to bring the beginning value of the investment (MVB) and all subsequent cash flows to the end value (MVE).

A comprehensive review of the dashboard is available in the Reference Manual under <code>View &gt; Performance</code>. As always, green values indicate a profit, while red signifies a loss.</p> <p>Figure 1.  Dashboard with key performance indicators - 2-year reporting period.</p> <p>To follow along with the text and Figure 2, download the demo-portfolio-03 file. We begin by examining the Calculation Widget (on the right side).</p> <ul> <li>Reporting period Select the 2-years reporting period from <code>2021-06-12</code> \u2192 <code>2023-06-12</code>. This implicates that your portfolio already contained some stock by June 12, 2021.</li> <li>Initial value This is the market value of the portfolio at the beginning of the reporting period (MVB), e.g. 177.94 EUR. At that day, your portfolio held 10 <code>share-1</code> valued at 17.79 EUR per share, totaling 177.94 EUR (look here for an overview of all transactions in the demo portfolio). Please note, that the historical price of the stock is taken, not the original buying price.</li> <li>Final value This is the market value of the portfolio at the end of the reporting period; e.g. 426.82 EUR. To verify the final value, navigate to <code>sidebar &gt; Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Calculation</code> and click on the <code>Assets at End</code> heading tab. The deposit account shows 125 EUR from dividend and sell transactions. <code>share-1</code> is valued at 190.06 EUR (10 remaining shares x 19.06), and <code>share-2</code> at 111.76 (8 shares x 13.97). In total, this sums to 426.62 EUR, representing the<code>Final (market value)</code>of your portfolio on June 12, 2023. However, note that this value includes the deposits made to purchase the stock, which should be excluded.     As you can see, the final value is almost equal to the sum of the items above.</li> <li>Performance neutral Transfers These are the deposits (external cash flows) you made in order to buy the assets. As can be seen from the transactions list, this is 84 EUR (additional <code>share-1</code>), and 67 EUR (<code>share-2</code>). Note that the original purchase of <code>share-1</code> (155 EUR) is not included because it felt outside the reporting period.</li> <li>Capital Gains represent the increase (or decrease) of the value of your stock between begin and end of the reporting period. Determining the buying value of <code>share-1</code> is somewhat complex due to the additional buy and sale. PP follows the FIFO (First-In-First-out) principle. From the remaining 10 shares, 5 will come from the first purchase and 5 from the second purchase. The historical quote at the first purchase date was 17.794 EUR/share and at the second purchase data 15.962 given an average price of (17.794 + 15.962)/2 = 16.878 EUR. The final market value is 19.006 EUR given a capital gain of 10 x (19.006-16.878) = 21.28 EUR. The value of <code>share-2</code> has increased from 8 EUR (at 2022-09-30) to 13.97 (at 2023-06-12) or 8 x 5.97 = 47.76 EUR. Added together gives a total Capital Gain of 69.04 EUR.</li> <li>Realized Capital Gains are the result of selling stock. Op <code>2023-04-12</code> you sold 5 <code>share-1</code> at 22.40 EUR/share. Given FIFO principle this gives a buying price of 17.794 EUR/share and produces a Realized Capital Gain of 5 x (22.40 - 17.794) = 23.03 EUR.  -Earnings is caused by dividend payments (15 x 2 = 30 EUR), while Fees and Taxes encompass all fees and taxes incurred in the reporting period. Keep in mind that fees and taxes were also paid for the purchase of <code>share-1</code>, outside the reporting period.</li> <li>Absolute Change The difference between the final and initial value; e.g. 426.82 - 177.94 = 248.88 EUR. In this case, you earned a profit: your portfolio is more worth than it was in the beginning. Note that this profit includes the investments or external cash inflows you made to buy additional shares.</li> <li>Delta (for the reporting period) is equal to the <code>Absolute Change</code> minus the <code>Performance neutral Transfers</code>, resulting in 97.88 EUR. You might be tempted to think that Delta should be equal to the sum of all sub calculations (Capital Gains + Realize Capital Gains, ...). As you may noted however, the numbers in the calculation panel do not add up; e.g. Final value &lt;&gt; Initial value + ... Otherwise, you would have counted some elements twice. For example, the result of the dividend and sale is put on a deposit account and as such already included in both the Realized Capital Gains and Earnings and also in the post Performance Neutral Transfers.</li> <li>Internal Rate of Return (IRR) stands at 17.63%. This is the annual interest rate required to bring the initial market value of 177.94 EUR and all subsequent cash flows of 151 EUR to the final market value of 426.82 EUR. Therefore, the IRR is a percentage illustrating how well your portfolio performs, considering when and how much money you've invested or withdrawn (more info here).</li> <li>Cumulative True Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TTWOR) is 25.58%. It represents the growth rate of your portfolio from 177.94 EUR to 426.82 EUR, excluding external cash flows. TTWOR measures the growth of your investments without being influenced by the timing and size of your contributions or withdrawals (more info here).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/trouble-shooting/","title":"Trouble shooting","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/trouble-shooting/#updating-error","title":"Updating error","text":"<p>If the program is corrupted or some files are missing, automatic updates are not feasible.

This new entity becomes a distinct, standalone company with its own management, operations, and often its own publicly traded stock.</p> <p>The shareholders of the original company may receive shares in the new entity in proportion to their holdings in the parent company. A distribution ratio determines how many shares of the new entity each shareholder receives for every share held in the original company.</p> <p>On December 10, 2021, Daimler AG successfully executed a spin-off, resulting in the establishment of a new entity known as Daimler Truck Holding AG. Simultaneously, the former Daimler AG underwent a name change to become Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Consequently, the XETRA stock exchange market now encompasses two distinct securities: ISIN DE0007100000 for Mercedes-Benz (formerly Daimler AG) and ISIN DE000DTR0CK8 for Daimler Truck Holding AG. The distribution ratio for this spin-off was 2:1, signifying that for every two shares of Daimler AG, shareholders received one share of Daimler Truck Holding AG.</p> <p>Figure 1.  Quote evolution of the Daimler Truck Holding and Mercedes-Benz Group. </p> <p>To record a spin-off in Portfolio Performance (PP), a suggested workflow, deduced from an in-depth discussion on the PP forum, involves the following steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Change the name of the security Daimler AG into Mercedes-Benz AG and create a new security Daimler Truck Holding AG in your portfolio.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a dividend transaction for the Mercedes security on December 10, 2021.

According to XETRA, the opening price of Daimler Truck Holding AG on December 10, 2021 was 28\u20ac/share (no fees or taxes).</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the same deposit account for the dividend and buy transaction. This way the result of the fictitious dividend transaction will be cancelled out by the real purchase transaction. The dividend of n shares x 14\u20ac/share = purchase of n/2 shares x 28\u20ac/share.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Figure 2.  Recording the spin-off of Daimler AG.</p> <p>This workflow solves the spin-off problem by simulating a dividend transaction followed by an equivalent purchase for the same amount. However, a drawback is that there is no real dividend, compromising the precision of the dividend overview.  Conversely, from a performance standpoint, treating the spin-off as a dividend makes sense. For example, there was a noticeable decline in the share price of the old Daimler AG, dropping from approximately \u20ac90 in mid-November 2021 to \u20ac74 on December 10, 2021, suggesting market anticipation of the impending spin-off.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/recording-stock-split/","title":"Recording a stock split","text":"<p>A stock split increases the number of shares in a company.

Historical Quotes chart of Amazon (unadjusted prices). </p> <p>Quite some confusion arises when you compare this chart with those from most other financial websites; for example, the 5-year chart from investing.com looks very different.</p> <p>Figure 2.  Historical Quotes chart of Amazon (adjusted prices). </p> <p>Both charts span an identical five-year period. But, while your purchase price was <code>$ 3408</code>, it appears to be priced around <code>$ 150</code> around January 2022. This discrepancy arises because financial websites typically \"adjust\" all historical prices after a stock split. This adjustment involves recalculating the historical prices before the split, just as the PP's Stock Split function does.</p> <p>Figure 3.  Historical Quotes chart of Amazon (adjusted prices). </p> <p>Important</p> <p>The \"regular\" Yahoo Finance Close Price is already adjusted for splits. The Adjusted close price is en surplus adjusted for splits and dividend and/or capital gain distributions.</p> <p>Some considerations</p> <ul> <li> <p>The built-in stock split function perfectly mirrors the approach adopted by most financial websites. This results in the Adjusted prices chart (Figure 3) being identical to those displayed on other platforms like investing.com or Yahoo Finance (Figure 2).</p> </li> <li> <p>It's crucial to recognize that the historical transactions and prices are permanently altered. This means that PP's records of past transactions will no longer accurately reflect the actual transactions as documented in your paper files. Over time, this may complicate the reconstruction of a security's history.</p> </li> <li> <p>A notable challenge arises when a split results in fractional shares, as seen in the case of Prosus' split announcement on September 14, 2023, with a ratio of 2.1796-for-1. In this scenario, 10 existing shares would be split into 21.796 shares. While PP can handle fractional shares, most brokers or banks cannot. Typically, they would adapt to this particular situation by issuing 21 new shares and providing compensation for the fractional share (0.796 shares in this case). Consequently, after the split, you'll need to record this compensation, which essentially involves executing a sell transaction of the fraction. Managing this process becomes notably more complex if you've made multiple purchases at different prices throughout the security's history.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"how-to/recording-stock-split/#use-of-sell-buy-back-operation","title":"Use of sell-buy-back operation","text":"<p>An alternative method that keeps the historical prices and transactions intact is the following sell-buy-back procedure. At the split date (ex-date)</p> <ul> <li>Sell all the shares at the closing price of the day preceding the split. Don't record any fees or taxes as this is an  internal operation. Leave the historical prices intact.</li> <li>Simultaneously, on the same date, acquire a new quantity of shares equivalent to the theoretical outcome of the split (old quantity x split ratio). Ensure that the total purchase amount matches the selling value determined earlier.</li> <li>Round down the new share quantity to the nearest whole number. If there is a remainder, sell it at the same price as described in step 2.</li> </ul> <p>Let's apply this workflow to the PROSUS split (2.1796-for-1) from above. Assume that you have bought 5 shares on 2022-01-03 on XETRA for 68.60 EUR per share and another 5 on 2023-01-03 for 73.90 EUR. The closing price on XETRA on 2023-09-13 was 64.11 EUR.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Selling old shares:</p> <ul> <li>You have a total of 10 shares (5 bought on 2022-01-03 and 5 bought on 2023-01-03).</li> <li>The closing price on XETRA on 2023-09-13 was 64.11 EUR.</li> <li>Total selling value = 10 shares * 64.11 EUR/share = 641.10 EUR.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Purchasing new shares:</p> <ul> <li>The split ratio is 2.1796-for-1.</li> <li>The theoretical new amount of shares = 10 shares * 2.1796 = 21.796 shares.</li> <li>The total purchase value must be the same as the selling value: 641.10 EUR.</li> <li>Buy 21.796 shares for 641.10/21.796 or 29.41 EUR/share</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Selling the remaining fraction:</p> <ul> <li>Round down to the nearest integer: 21 shares.</li> <li>Fractional share remaining after rounding down = 21.796 - 21 = 0.796 shares.</li> <li>Sell the remaining fraction at the acquiring price, which is 29.41 EUR/share.</li> <li>Value of the remaining fraction = 0.796 shares * 29.41 EUR/share = 23.41 EUR.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>In Figure 4 a comparison of the two methods (built-in function vs sell-buy-back) is made. As can be seen, the price range is 15 - 50 for the built-in split and 20 - 100 for the sell-buy-back method. The original buying prices are preserved in the latter case. Of course, the graph wouldn't look as nice for the Amazon 20-for-1 split.</p> <p>Figure 4.  Comparison of the two methods (Prosus example).</p> <p>Please note that the security performance (top-right) is practically the same for built-in split vs sell-buy-back: IRR is respectively -6.05% vs -6.11%. The small difference is caused by the selling of the fraction (0.796 share) at a bad time (29.41 vs 29.54 EUR) in case of the sell-buy-back method.</p> <p>The Trades Performance view gives additional info. Because we haven't solved the fractional share problem in the built-in split method, there is only one open trade: purchased 21.796 shares (2 x 10,898) and not sold yet. Remember that in your real bank account, you only have 21 shares. We haven't compensated for the fractional shares, which would be much more difficult in the built-in split method.</p> <p>Let's compare with the sell-buy-back method. The open trade represents the 21 shares purchased on 2023-09-14. This trade has a positive performance (IRR = 1.03%). Prices have been increased since then. The previous period (the closed trade) however was negative (IRR= -8.40%). This puts the overall negative security performance of -6.11 in perspective. The IRR of the small closed trade of selling the 0.796 fraction is NaN (Not a Number). Because this trade is purchased and sold at the same price on the same day, the performance could not be calculated.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/reinvesting-dividends/","title":"Reinvesting dividends","text":"<p>How do you book the reinvestment of a dividend? What about DRIP? A dividend is the payment of a part of the company's profit to its shareholders. Sometimes you can choose to receive this dividend in cash or in shares. But how should you register this latter share dividend.</p> <p>For example, at the annual general meeting of the NN Group, the shareholders approved a final dividend of EUR 1.56. The final dividend will be paid either fully in cash, after deduction of withholding tax if applicable, or fully in ordinary shares, at the election of the shareholders. The following example is about the choice dividend (300 shares) of a Dutch company, paid to a non-resident investor. The dividend is 1.56 EUR/share. The converting ratio is 1 new share for 29.43 old shares. The historical quote at the pay date is 45.91 EUR.</p> <ul> <li> <p>you choose for cash dividend. You receive the net amount of 278.46 EUR. 300 shares * 1.56 EUR = 468 EUR minus foreign taxes (15% or 70.2 EUR), minus fees (0 EUR), minus domestic taxes (30% or 119.34 EUR).</p> </li> <li> <p>You choose for share dividend. You receive 10 shares at 45.91 and 5 cash dividends (6.63 EUR). You have to pay some fees (3.50 EUR) and domestic taxes (140.09 EUR).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Theoretically, there is no difference between the two choices. 300 shares/29.43 * 45.91 ~= 300 shares * 1.56 EUR.</p> <p>In this example, the broker doesn't allow share fractions. So, you only receive 10 additional new shares (not 10.19 shares) for 295 old shares and a pay-out of the remaining 5 old shares dividend.</p> <p>The domestic taxes are much larger for the share dividend (30%) than if you should buy the shares from your cash account(0.35%) (140.09 EUR). Of course, if the dividends are paid in cash, then you would also have paid domestic taxes. Either way, the government receives the same amount.</p> <p>In this particular example, there is a small benefit because there are no foreign taxes (15%) in case of a share dividend.</p> <p>There has been a lot of debate about how to book these transactions in PP. My understanding of the proposed procedure is:</p> <ul> <li>book the dividends for all shares without fees and taxes. These will be paid for in the following step. If your broker doesn't allow for share fractions, you can use one transaction for the share dividend part (e.g. 295 in the example) without fees &amp; taxes and another transaction with taxes and fees for the cash dividend. </li> <li>buy the allocated shares at the same day with the theoretical historical quote and the associated fees and taxes.</li> </ul> <p>Figure 1.  Implementation in PP</p> <p>Please note that in this example the total outflow is much larger the inflow from the dividend payment. This is because the number of reinvested shares is calculated on the gross amount. So, all taxes and fees are in surplus of this choice dividend.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/test/","title":"processing a broker's transaction file","text":"<ul> <li>download all necessary info: begin situation + transactions</li> <li>check if PP portfolio value is the same as broker</li> <li>prepare the broker transactions (recode, ..)<ul> <li>clean up file: remove first lines, remove empty columns (unmerge cells), sort by date ascending</li> </ul> </li> <li>import piece wise: first account transactions, (no better by date)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"how-to/downloading-historical-prices/","title":"Downloading Historical Stock Prices","text":"<p>Figure 1.

It contains meta data of the security, Unix timestamps from the two retrieved dates, and the different quote prices. You need a JSON path to retrieve the different values:</p> <ul> <li>Error code of the reponse: <code>$.chart.error</code></li> <li>Metadata of the security: <code>$.chart.result[0].meta</code>. The result field is an array, even though there is only one element, probably because one can also ask data for multiple securities.</li> <li>Symbol name: <code>$.chart.result[0].meta.symbol</code></li> <li>Requested dates: <code>$.chart.result[0].timestamp[*]</code>. The * serves as wildcard, facilitating the retrieval of all values.</li> <li>Second date: <code>$.chart.result[0].timestamp[1]</code></li> <li>All available quotes (incl adjusted quotes): <code>$.chart.result[0].indicators</code></li> <li>All non-adjusted quotes: <code>$.chart.result[0].indicators.quote[0]</code></li> <li>Close quotes: <code>$.chart.result[0].indicators.quote[0].close</code></li> <li>Close quote of the first date: <code>$.chart.result[0].indicators.quote[0].close[0]</code></li> </ul> <p>If you want to practice, you can use the JSONPath Online Evaluator.

At each step, you are required to furnish additional information.</p> <p>Step 1. Start with the menu <code>File &gt; Import &gt; CSV files (comma-separated values)</code>, navigate to the correct folder and select the appropriate CSV file. Only files with the extension <code>CSV</code> are displayed.</p> <p>A CSV file is simply a text file. The first line contains the names of the fields (columns); separated by a marker such as a comma. The second and following lines contain the data, also separated by a marker. The number and type of fields the file should contain, depend on the type of import. The names in the heading can be freely chosen, although it is preferable for them to match PP's internal usage, as it simplifies the mapping process (associating each column with its corresponding field in PP). The printout of a CSV file in Table 1 (see below) comprises two fields or columns and four lines of data that could be utilized for importing historical prices.</p> <p>In step 2 of the wizard, you need to select the appropriate import type or template by clicking on the drop down box (see Figure 3). PP distinguishes between 5 types of import: <code>Account Transactions</code>, <code>Portfolio Transactions</code>, <code>Securities</code>, <code>Historical Quotes</code>, and <code>Securities Account</code>. These templates are discussed in detail below. You also need to decide about the following options.</p> <ul> <li>Delimiter: PP will probably choose the correct delimiter; in this case a semicolon. Other possibilities include comma and the tab symbol.</li> <li>Encoding: \"strange\" characters in the output table indicate a mismatch between the chosen encoding and the source file encoding. There are numerous possibilities, and the correct choice depends on the application used to create the file. A good choice is likely <code>UTF-8</code> or <code>Windows-1250</code>. </li> <li>First line contains header: enable this option if the first line of your CSV contains field  labels.</li> <li>Skip lines: sometimes the CSV-file contains irrelevant information in the first few lines. You can skip them with this option.</li> <li>Mapping fields: PP needs to determine the corresponding columns for its internal fields. If PP recognizes a field, it will be indicated by a message <code>-&gt; 'Field'</code> in the second row of the output; otherwise, a message <code>Double click here</code> will appear (see Figure 3). To associate a column with an internal PP field, double-click on the second line. You can then choose from the available fields. If you don't want to associate a field, select the <code>---</code> option. PP will then ignore this column. To change the format of a column, e.g. Date format of a date, double-click on the name in the second line.</li> </ul> <p>Figure 2.  Saving the mapping configuration.</p> <ul> <li>Save Configuration (Gear icon): To save the current mapping, click on the gear icon to the right of \"Type of data.\" A list of <code>Built-in configurations</code> will be displayed, such as comDirect, Consorsbank, etc. (see Figure 3). Using the option <code>Save current configuration</code> will save your current mapping configuration as a custom template. This template will be available under <code>User-specific Configurations</code>, for example, <code>test (Account Transactions)</code> (see Figure 2). You can delete, export, and import configurations. The export function uses a JSON format.</li> </ul> <p>Step 3: set additional info, depending on the import type such as accounts and check the preview of the import process.

Available columns.  The default columns that are displayed are <code>Shares</code>, <code>Name</code>, <code>Symbol</code>, <code>Quote</code>, <code>Market Value</code>, <code>Share in %</code>, and <code>Note</code>. Many more columns/fields are available (see Figure 3). While the column headings are mostly self-explanatory, a few of them may require further clarification. You can customize the default columns using the gear icon located in the top-right corner (see Figure 2).</p> <p>The abbreviation \"MA\" that follows Purchase Price/Value stands for \"Moving Average\" but in fact it should be better called WA or \"Weighted Average\". As mentioned in the discussion about Purchase Value, PP uses the FIFO (First-in, First-out) method to calculate prices and values. \"Moving/weighted average\", however, is another commonly used method.</p> <p>The Purchase Price and the Purchase Price (MA) of <code>share-1</code> are respectively 44.41 EUR and 51.61 EUR; a rather big difference. Why? From Figure 2:</p> <ul> <li>Purchase of 50 shares at 58.82 EUR on December 14, 2020.</li> <li>Purchase of 30 shares at 39.60 EUR on September 29, 2022.</li> <li>Sale of 40 shares at 72.48 EUR on September 28, 2023.</li> </ul> <p>What is the Purchase Price of the remaining 40 shares in the portfolio?</p> <ul> <li>The moving/weighted average method states that the average price of the original 80 shares was ((50 x 58.82) + (30 x 39.60))/80 = 51.6125 EUR. The remaining 40 shares are valuated at this price.</li> <li>The FIFO method asserts that the remaining 40 shares are composed of 10 shares of the first purchase and 30 shares of the second purchase. The average price is thus ((10 x 58.82) + (30 x 39.60))/40 = 44.405 EUR.</li> </ul> <p>The available fields under <code>Performance</code> and <code>Dividends</code> are discussed in a separate chapter.</p> <p>With the <code>Attributes</code> option, you can add custom fields to the table. These fields are defined in <code>left sidebar &gt; settings &gt; Attributes: Securities</code> and following panels. You can enter a specific attribute value for a security in the <code>Additional attributes</code> panel of the security (see for example, Figure 3 in Getting started &gt; Adding securities)</p> <p>The <code>Forex</code> (Foreign Exchange) option allows you to view the currency of the quote for each asset and its exchange rate relative to the base currency of the portfolio. The fields labeled as <code>Market value**</code>, <code>Purchase Price**</code>, and <code>Profit/Loss**</code> retain the same meaning as their counterparts in the base currency, but they are presented in the foreign currency.</p> <p>For instance, let's consider <code>share-2</code>, which is traded in USD. In the default view, the Market Value is expressed in EUR. If you wish to view that value in USD instead, you can achieve this by adding the <code>Market Value**</code> field.</p> <p>The <code>Distance to SMA</code> is a metric that measures the difference between the current price of a share and the average price of that share over a specified number of past days. The acronym \"SMA\" presumably represents \"Simple Moving Average.\"</p> <p>When you choose to include this column, you'll also need to specify a period, such as 5 days, 20 days, 50 days, or 200 days. Suppose that you want to know the \u0394 to SMA5 (Distance to SMA for a 5 days period) of <code>share-1</code>. The last 5 available prices are: 71.96, 72.00, 72.42, 73.52, and 74.50 EUR; including the latest available on October, 5 (= 71.96 EUR). The calculation is carried out as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Calculate the average price of the last 5 days, including today = (71.96 + ... + 74.50)/5 = 72.88 EUR.</li> <li>Calculate the difference of today's price with the average price = 71.96 - 72.88 = -0.92 EUR.</li> <li>Divide this difference by the average price and convert to a percentage = -0.92/72.88 = -1.26%. The current price (October 5) is 1.26% lower than the average price of the last 5 days.</li> </ol> <p><code>Distance to ATH</code> (All Time High) is a likewise metric that shows how far the current price is from the highest price in the specified period. For example, the highest price of share-1 in the last year was 77.4 EUR. The current price is 71.96 EUR. So the \u0394 ATH 1 year (Distance to ATH for a 1 year period) is equal to (71.96 - 77.4)/77.4 or -7.03%. </p> <p># Available views</p> <p>Using the <code>Reset Columns</code> option in Figure 3, you can revert to the default arrangement of columns.

Essentially, it retroactively assumes that the shares have always been split. In the aforementioned scenario of a 20-for-1 stock split, the historical share prices before June 6, 2022, are adjusted to 1/20 of their previous value, while the quantity of units in transactions is multiplied by 20.
