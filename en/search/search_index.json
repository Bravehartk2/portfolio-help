These could be buy and sell transactions of securities (shares, \u2026) in case of a Securities account or the withdrawal and deposit of money for a Deposit account. Each account has a default\u00a0currency attached. As part of the installation procedure, you should already have created at least one Securities account and one Deposit account.</p> <p>PP has two main type accounts: Securities and Deposit accounts. They are rather well described in the Guide on getting started of Thomas (Contributor); you have to scroll quite a bit down.</p> <p>Other related terms are \u201cInvestment Plans\u201d, \u201cAll Transactions\u201d, \u201cReference account\u201d and \u201cOffset account\u201d. Sometimes a Deposit Account is called a Cash Account.</p>"},{"location":"accounts/#deposit-account","title":"Deposit account","text":"Figure 1: Example of a Deposit Account <p>In figure 1, there are two deposit accounts; named EUR and USD (in column Cash Account). They will be used for deposits and withdrawals in EUR or USD. It's a bit redundant to call them \u201cEUR\u201d and \u201cUSD\u201d because you also have to specify the currency that the account will use (see third column in figure). Then, for example, when you want to book a dividend in EUR, you will get the following dialog. The cash account can be selected from a drop-down and the correct currency is automatically added.</p> <p></p> Figure 2: Deposit Account with redundant Currency <p>According to your needs, you can use other names. For example, if you want to collect all of your dividends or taxes in a separate account, you could name them \u201cDividends\u201d and \u201cTaxes\u201d in stead of EUR and USD. Of course, you also have to decide which currency that will be used for them. And, if you receive dividends in both EUR and USD then you need two deposit accounts with the name \u201cDividends\u201d but with different currencies.</p> <p>Another possibility is to name the deposit accounts with the name of the bank or broker they belong to; e.g. BNPPF, Deutsche Bank, \u2026</p> <p>A deposit account is used to transfer or receive money as the result of a transaction. In figure\u00a01 (bottom part), 4 buy/sell transactions result in a negative balance (-2210 EUR). Good practice however requires that you first add a deposit of a large enough sum to cover the subsequent buy transactions; just as you should do with a real broker.</p>"},{"location":"accounts/#securities-account","title":"Securities account","text":"<p>A security account will hold your securities and will be used for buying or selling securities.
