This page contains a few links excellent sites.</li> <li>Account: An account is a collection of transactions. PP uses several terms to indicate the concept of account: Securities, Deposit, Reference, Cash, Offset, ... account. What do they mean and in what aspects do they differ?</li> <li>Transaction: A financial transaction is an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. In case of PP, the exchange is about securities. There are security transactions such as buy, sell delivery (inbound), and delivery (outbound); deposit transactions such as deposit, removal, interest, interest charge, fees, fees refund, taxes, tax refund; and dividend transactions.</li> <li>Reporting period: The (reporting) period is the time slice that is taken into account for reporting (calculations, graphs, statistics). It's very important that you realize that for every performance calculation a reporting period is taken into account, even if you haven't set one explicitly.</li> <li>Purchase value: The Purchase Value of a security is the summed\u00a0value\u00a0of each buy (+) and sell (-) transaction of that security, taken into account the reporting period.

These transactions could include buy and sell transactions of securities (shares, etc.) for a Securities account or withdrawals and deposits of money for a Deposit account.

Notice the column heading \"Cash Account\". The bottom panel shows the transactions of the selected Deposit Account <code>Broker-1 (EUR)</code>.</p> <p>Deposit Accounts are used for deposits and withdrawals in EUR and USD in the two broker accounts. It's somewhat redundant to add \"EUR\" and \"USD\" in the name because you also need to specify the currency for each deposit account (see the third column in Figure 1). On the other hand, in many dialogs (for example when buying a security) you need to specify the deposit account. The added currency in the name of the deposit account will help you then choosing the correct one.</p> <p>Of course, you can use other names depending on your needs. For example, if you want to keep all your dividends and taxes in a separate account, you could name it <code>Dividends</code> and <code>Taxes</code>. If you receive dividends in both EUR and USD, then you need also two deposit accounts with the name <code>Dividends</code> but with different currencies.</p> <p>A deposit account is used to transfer or receive money as the result of a transaction. In Figure 1, the balance of <code>Broker-1 (EUR)</code> reflects the deposit of 3000 EUR and the purchase of each 2969.12 EUR. A deposit account can be negative.

It is expressed as an annual interest rate that is necessary to bring the initial value of the investment at time $t_{0}$ to the final value at time $t_{n}$. In PP, the reporting period is measured in days. The IRR can apply for a specific security or trade or the whole portfolio. The classic equation to explain the meaning of IRR is:</p> <p>Eq (1)    $CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}}+\\frac{CF_{t2}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_2}{365}}+...+ \\frac{CF_{tn}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_n}{365}}$</p> <p>$CF_{t0}$ is the initial cashflow at time $t_0$. It is the sum of all in- and outflows at that moment in time and represents your initial investment. $CF_{t1}$, $CF_{tn}$ are the -hopefully positive- net cashflows that your initial investment will yield. PP works with periods of 1 day instead of the classical periods of 1 year. Therefore $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_n$ should be converted to the number of days between $t_0$ and $t_n$. Of course, if the period between $t_0$ and $t_n$ is  for example 365 days, the exponent becomes 1. Eq (1) is a direct derivation from the classic formula of present value.</p> <p>A simple example. There is also a IRR Practical example step-by-step, solved in PP. On 2021-01-15 you have bought 10 shares at 17 EUR. Now (2023-06-15) the price has increased to 18.5 EUR. Meanwhile, you have received a dividend of 1.5 EUR/share on 2021-09-10 and a second dividend of 1.7 EUR/share on 2022-09-10. What is the performance or IRR of this security? Let's first have the timing and cashflows correct.</p> Table 1: Cash flows at different times of investment. Date $t_n$ $CF_n$ 2021-01-15 170\u20ac 2021-09-15 243d 15\u20ac 2022-09-15 608d 17\u20ac 2023-06-15 881d 185\u20ac <p>According to (1)</p> <p>$$CF_{t0} = \\frac{15}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{243}{365}}+\\frac{17}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{608}{365}}+ \\frac{185}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{881}{365}}$$</p> <p>What's the value of $CF_{t0}$ if IRR is for example 5%? Or 15%?</p> <p>Figure 1.  Calculating IRR</p> <p>If IRR = 15% then the combined future cashflows are worth 159.16 EUR in 2021-01-15. So, you need less money (than 170 EUR) to get the same financial results.  So, the real IRR should be somewhat lower. With 5% however, you need in 2021 about 194.64 EUR to get the same total cashflows. After some guesswork and interpolation you get at the exact IRR = 11.61% that will bring all future cashflow to the precise initial investment of 170 EUR.</p> <p>In the previous example, the dividends are immediately \"consumed\" (you got yourself a nice meal from it). In another scenario, you keep the dividends in your drawer until 2023-06-15 and cash them in at the same moment you sell the share. In that case, there are only two cashflows: $CF_{t0}$ = 170 EUR and $CF_{t881}$ = 15 + 17 +185 EUR.</p> <p>Equation (1) has only two terms and could be solved for IRR rather easily.</p> <p>Eq (2)    $CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}} \\implies  IRR = \\sqrt[\\frac{t_1}{365}]{\\frac{CF_{t1}}{CF_{t0}}}-1$</p> <p>In this case, your initial investment of 170 EUR has an IRR = $\\sqrt[\\frac{881}{365}]{\\frac{217}{170}}-1$ = 10.64%. Why is this IRR smaller than the previous one? Because you kept the dividend until a later date, the 15 EUR in 2021-09-15 is less worth in 2023-06-15.</p> <p>PP calculates three variants of IRR.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Performance IRR: this is the IRR for the whole project and a specific reporting period; see side bar &gt; Reports &gt; Performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security IRR: the IRR of a selected security for a specific reporting period; see sidebar &gt; Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Securities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trade IRR: the IRR of a buy-sell cycle of a selected security.

Because all purchases fall before the reporting period, the value for each of them is taken from the beginning of the period. At that time (2022, May 15), the share was valued at a quote of 110 EUR (see graph). So, the total purchase value is 30 shares * 110 = 3300 EUR.

The beginning of the period or Statement of Assets is the result of the first buy (2020, Jan 1) takes the quote from the beginning of the period (2020, May 15) which is the same as the purchase quote (e.g. 100 EUR); resulting in a purchase of 5 * 100 EUR = 500 EUR.</p> <p>The previous explanation can be seen in the pop-over, when hovering the mouse over the Purchase Value (see Figure 3).</p> <p>Figure 3.  Pop-over panel for Purchase value field.</p> <p>The custom period (from 2000, Jan 1 (not included) until 2020, Jan 1 (included) has a Purchase Value of 500 EUR because it contains only the first buy (= 5 * 100 EUR). The second and third buy or not taken into account because they occur later than the period end. Things become more complicated -but with the same logic- when there are also sell transactions. Important to remember is that PP use a FIFO (First In, First OUT) method to calculate the result of a sell transaction. Suppose that you did a (rather bad timed) sell at 2021, Jul 1 2020 of 12 shares (see Figure 4).</p> <p>Figure 4.  Overview and graph of all buy and sell transactions.</p> <p>At that moment there were 15 shares available (5 at 100 EUR and 10 at 90 EUR). Selling 12 of them will first sell the 5 shares of 100 EUR and then another 2 of 90 EUR, leaving 3 shares of 90 EUR available.</p> <p>Now, let's calculate the Purchase Value for the different periods.</p> <ul> <li> <p>1 year period: The period runs from 2022, May 15 until 2023, May 15. All purchases are done before the beginning of the period; so each of them is valued at the price of 2022, May 15, which is 110 EUR. How many shares are available? 5 + 10 - 12 + 15 = 18 at 110 EUR or 1980 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>2 years period running from 2021, May 15 until 2023, May 15. Only the last buy transaction falls within the period and is evaluated at its current quote (110 EUR). The Statement of Assets consists of 3 shares (15 buy - 12 sell). They are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (90 EUR). The Purchase Value for the 2 years period is: 3 * 90 EUR + 15 * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>3 years period running from 2020, May 15 until 2023, May 15. The Statement of Assets is 0 EUR because all 5 shares from buy 1 are sold (FIFO) on 2021, Jul 15. From the second buy, only 3 shares are remaining, evaluated at 90 EUR. The third buy is evaluated at 110 EUR. The Purchase Value of the 3 years period is 3 shares * 90 EUR + 15 shares * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR. Longer periods have the same Purchase Value.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"concepts/reporting-period/","title":"Reporting period","text":"<p>Figure 1.

What about DRIP? A dividend is the payment of a part of the company's profit to its shareholders. Sometimes you can choose to receive this dividend in cash or in shares. But how should you register this latter share dividend.</p> <p>For example, at the annual general meeting of the NN Group, the shareholders approved a final dividend of EUR 1.56. The final dividend will be paid either fully in cash, after deduction of withholding tax if applicable, or fully in ordinary shares, at the election of the shareholders. The following example is about the choice dividend (300 shares) of a Dutch company, paid to a non-resident investor. The dividend is 1.56 EUR/share. The converting ratio is 1 new share for 29.43 old shares. The historical quote at the pay date is 45.91 EUR.</p> <ul> <li> <p>you choose for cash dividend. You receive the net amount of 278.46 EUR. 300 shares * 1.56 EUR = 468 EUR minus foreign taxes (15% or 70.2 EUR), minus fees (0 EUR), minus domestic taxes (30% or 119.34 EUR).</p> </li> <li> <p>You choose for share dividend. You receive 10 shares at 45.91 and 5 cash dividends (6.63 EUR). You have to pay some fees (3.50 EUR) and domestic taxes (140.09 EUR).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Theoretically, there is no difference between the two choices. 300 shares/29.43 * 45.91 ~= 300 shares * 1.56 EUR.</p> <p>In this example, the broker doesn't allow share fractions. So, you only receive 10 additional new shares (not 10.19 shares) for 295 old shares and a pay-out of the remaining 5 old shares dividend.</p> <p>The domestic taxes are much larger for the share dividend (30%) than if you should buy the shares from your cash account(0.35%) (140.09 EUR). Of course, if the dividends are paid in cash, then you would also have paid domestic taxes. Either way, the government receives the same amount.</p> <p>In this particular example, there is a small benefit because there are no foreign taxes (15%) in case of a share dividend.</p> <p>There has been a lot of debate about how to book these transactions in PP. My understanding of the proposed procedure is:</p> <ul> <li>book the dividends for all shares without fees and taxes. These will be paid for in the following step. If your broker doesn't allow for share fractions, you can use one transaction for the share dividend part (e.g. 295 in the example) without fees &amp; taxes and another transaction with taxes and fees for the cash dividend. </li> <li>buy the allocated shares at the same day with the theoretical historical quote and the associated fees and taxes.</li> </ul> <p>Figure 1.  Implementation in PP</p> <p>Please note that in this example the total outflow is much larger the inflow from the dividend payment.
