Portfolio performance is all about numbers. It is easy to completely miscalculate or misinterpret these numbers, if you don't understand the underlying assumptions.</p> <ul> <li>Financial terminology: Understanding basic financial terminology is crucial for optimal usage of PP and this manual. This page contains a few links excellent sites.</li> <li>Account: An account is a collection of transactions. PP uses several terms to indicate the concept of account: Securities, Deposit, Reference, Cash, Offset, ... account. What do they mean and in what aspects do they differ?</li> <li>Transaction: A financial transaction is an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. In case of PP, the exchange is about securities. There are security transactions such as buy, sell delivery (inbound), and delivery (outbound); deposit transactions such as deposit, removal, interest, interest charge, fees, fees refund, taxes, tax refund; and dividend transactions.</li> <li>Reporting period: The (reporting) period is the time slice that is taken into account for reporting (calculations, graphs, statistics). It's very important that you realize that for every performance calculation a reporting period is taken into account, even if you haven't set one explicitly.</li> <li>Purchase value: The Purchase Value of a security is the summed\u00a0value\u00a0of each buy (+) and sell (-) transaction of that security, taken into account the reporting period. The value of a transaction includes the taxes and fees; sometimes also called \u201cNet Transaction Value\u201d.</li> <li>Performance: Measuring your portfolio's performance may seem straightforward, but it involves a range of concepts and calculation techniques that require explanation.</li> <li>Internal Rate of Return (IRR): The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) measures the performance of an investment between two dates.

These transactions could include buy and sell transactions of securities (shares, etc.) for a Securities account or withdrawals and deposits of money for a Deposit account.

Notice the column heading \"Cash Account\". The bottom panel shows the transactions of the selected Deposit Account <code>Broker-1 (EUR)</code>.</p> <p>Deposit Accounts are used for deposits and withdrawals in EUR and USD in the two broker accounts. It's somewhat redundant to add \"EUR\" and \"USD\" in the name because you also need to specify the currency for each deposit account (see the third column in Figure 1). On the other hand, in many dialogs (for example when buying a security) you need to specify the deposit account. The added currency in the name of the deposit account will help you then choosing the correct one.</p> <p>Of course, you can use other names depending on your needs. For example, if you want to keep all your dividends and taxes in a separate account, you could name it <code>Dividends</code> and <code>Taxes</code>. If you receive dividends in both EUR and USD, then you need also two deposit accounts with the name <code>Dividends</code> but with different currencies.</p> <p>A deposit account is used to transfer or receive money as the result of a transaction. In Figure 1, the balance of <code>Broker-1 (EUR)</code> reflects the deposit of 3000 EUR and the purchase of each 2969.12 EUR. A deposit account can be negative.

In the first trade (share-1 closed), 5 shares of the first buy of 10 shares are sold. The net transaction value of this first purchase was 155 EUR (see Figure 1).

It is expressed as an annual interest rate that is necessary to bring the initial value of the investment at time $t_{0}$ to the final value at time $t_{n}$. In PP, the reporting period is measured in days. The classic equation to explain the meaning of IRR is:</p> <p>Eq (1)    $CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}}+\\frac{CF_{t2}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_2}{365}}+...+ \\frac{CF_{tn}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_n}{365}}$</p> <p>$CF_{t0}$ is the initial cashflow at time $t_0$. It is the sum of all in- and outflows at that moment in time and represents your initial investment. $CF_{t1}$, $CF_{tn}$ are the net cashflows that your initial investment will yield. PP works with daily periods instead of the traditional annual periods. Therefore, $t_1$, $t_2$, and $t_n$ should be converted to the number of days between $t_0$ and $t_n$. Of course, if the period between $t_0$ and $t_n$ is, for example, 365 days, the exponent becomes 1 as in the more traditional version of the equation. Eq (1) is derived from the calculation of the present value of a future cashflow.</p> <p>The IRR can be measured for a specific trade, security or the whole portfolio. Here's a simple example. Additionally, there is also a more complex Practical step-by-step example, solved in PP.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>On <code>2021-01-15</code>, you purchased 10 shares at 17 EUR each. As of today (<code>2023-06-15</code>), the price has risen to 18.5 EUR per share.

Calculating CF0 for IRR = 5% and 15%.</p> <p>If IRR = 15% then the combined future cashflows are worth 159.16 EUR in <code>2021-01-15</code>. So, you need less money (than 170 EUR) to get the same financial results.  The real IRR should be somewhat lower. With 5% however, you need 194.64 EUR to get the same total cashflows in 2021. After some guesswork and interpolation, you arrive at the exact IRR of 11.61%, which will precisely bring all future cash flows to the initial investment of 170 EUR.</p> <p>In the previous example, the dividends are immediately \"consumed\": you got yourself a nice meal from it. In another scenario, you keep the dividends in your drawer - or in PP terminology: a deposit account -  until <code>2023-06-15</code> and cash them in at the same moment you sell the share. In that case, there are only two cashflows: $CF_{t0}$ = 170 EUR and $CF_{t881}$ = 15 + 17 +185 EUR.</p> <p>Equation (1) has only two terms and could be solved for IRR rather easily.</p> <p>Eq (2)    $CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}} \\implies  IRR = \\sqrt[\\frac{t_1}{365}]{\\frac{CF_{t1}}{CF_{t0}}}-1$</p> <p>In this case, your initial investment of 170 EUR has an IRR = $\\sqrt[\\frac{881}{365}]{\\frac{217}{170}}-1$ = 10.64%. Why is this IRR smaller than the previous one? Because you kept the dividend until a later date, the 15 EUR in <code>2021-09-15</code> is less worth in <code>2023-06-15</code>.</p> <p>PP calculates three variants of IRR.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Performance IRR: this is the IRR for the whole project and a specific reporting period; see <code>side bar &gt; Reports &gt; Performance</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security IRR: the IRR of a selected security for a specific reporting period; see <code>sidebar &gt; Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Securities</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trade IRR: the IRR of a buy-sell cycle of a selected security.

To handle such situations effectively, you can choose between a money-weighted or time-weighted approach.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/performance/#money-weighted-rate-of-return","title":"Money-weighted Rate of Return","text":"<p>The money-weighted rate of return is essentially the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the cash flows associated with the portfolio. This calculation considers both the timing (when) and the amount (how much) of the cash moves into and out of the portfolio. The money-weighted rate of return or IRR is the annual interest rate that is necessary to bring the start value of the investment to the end value. To generate the specified cash flows within the given time period, your portfolio must grow each year by a percentage equal to the IRR.</p> <p>The base formula to calculate the IRR (see also IRR theory) looks like: $$CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}}+\\frac{CF_{t2}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_2}{365}}+...+ \\frac{CF_{tn}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_n}{365}} \\qquad\\mathrm{(Eq 2)}$$</p> <p>For each cash flow CF at time $t_1$, $t_2$, ..., $t_n$, you calculate its present value by dividing it by ${(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}}$, where t is the number of days from the reference time t0. This part discounts the future cash flows to their present values, considering the time value of money. Choosing an appropriate IRR will ensure that the sum of all discounted cash flows equals the initial investment or $CF_{t0}$.</p> <p>It's easy to see from Eq 2 that the value of IRR is influenced by the magnitude of the cash flow. If the cash flow CF increases, the IRR must also become larger to balance the equation. If the exponent $\\frac{t_2}{365}$ increases, the value of IRR should decrease. Therefore, IRR is a money-weighted rate of return.</p> <p>In IRR - Practical example, you will find a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the IRR calculation for our demonstration portfolio.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/performance/#time-weighted-rate-of-return","title":"Time-weighted Rate of Return","text":"<p>The time-weighted rate of return is not influenced by the amount invested. Whether you invest 1 EUR or 100 EUR, you will achieve the same return. The reporting period is divided into several holding periods, and for each holding period, a return value is calculated and then compounded into an overall return. Each period carries equal weight. In the True time-weighted methodology (TTWROR), performance is calculated using simple returns without any consideration for the total amount invested.</p> <p>PP computes the TTWOR as follows. For each day within the reporting period, it collects the total portfolio value, inbound transfers, and outbound transfers. The portfolio value encompasses all deposit and securities accounts. To determine the value of a security, it multiplies the quantity by the (historical) price. Transfers encompass external cash flows, which can either enter the portfolio from outside (inbound) or exit it (outbound); assuming that fresh money is added at the beginning of the day (and hence is available to generate return) and removed at the end of the day. A dividend or sale transaction is not considered as a transfer; they remain within the portfolio. They are recorded in the cash account, thereby contributing to the increased valuation of the portfolio. A modified version of the simple return formula (see eq 1), including the transfers, is used to calculate the daily return value (named delta).</p> <p>The total compounded return can be calculated as follows: $$r = [(1 + r_1) * (1 + r_2) * (1 + r_3) ... (1 + r_{n-1}) * (1 + r_n)] - 1$$</p> <p>This formula follows directly from Eq 1, which can be rewritten as:</p> <p>$$\\frac{V_1}{V_S} * \\frac{V_2}{V_1} * \\frac{V_3}{V_2} ... \\frac{V_{n-1}}{V_{n-2}} * \\frac{V_E}{V_{n-1}}= \\frac{V_E}{V_S}= 1 + r$$</p> <p>$V_t$ is the value of the portfolio after the end of period t and each sub-period effectively cancels itself out.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/purchase-value/","title":"Purchase Value","text":"<p>The Purchase Value of a security is the summed\u00a0value\u00a0of each buy (+) and sell (-) transaction of that security, taken into account the reporting period.

Purchase Value and Purchase Price are used in Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Securities (see figure 1)</p> <p>Figure 1.  Purchase value of a security</p> <p>Assume the following scenario. We are now 2023, May, 15th and you have bought 30 shares at different times and quotes (see figure 2). An overview of all buys and their respective quotes is shown in figure.</p> <p>Figure 2.  List of Buy transactions of security example</p> <p>The reported purchase value of a particular security is dependent upon the selected reporting period.

Because all purchases fall before the reporting period, the value for each of them is taken from the beginning of the period. At that time (2022, May 15), the share was valued at a quote of 110 EUR (see graph). So, the total purchase value is 30 shares * 110 = 3300 EUR. This is the beginning situation of the period (also called Statement of Assets). Since, there are no purchases afterwards, this amount is also the purchase value of the 1 year period.</p> <p>The 2 years period starts at 2021, May 15. Only the third buy falls within the period. So, buy 1 and buy 2 are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (= 90 EUR). So, the Statement of Assets equals 1350 EUR. There is one buy afterwards (valued at the buying quote). The total Purchase Value of this 2 year period is therefore (5 + 10) shares at 90 EUR + 15 shares at 110 EUR or 1350 +1650 = 3000 EUR.</p> <p>The 3 years period start at 2020, May 15. The second and third buy lie within the reporting period and are evaluated at their respective quotes: 10 shares at 90 EUR (= 900 EUR) and 15 shares at 110 EUR (= 1650 EUR). The beginning of the period or Statement of Assets is the result of the first buy (2020, Jan 1) takes the quote from the beginning of the period (2020, May 15) which is the same as the purchase quote (e.g. 100 EUR); resulting in a purchase of 5 * 100 EUR = 500 EUR.</p> <p>The previous explanation can be seen in the pop-over, when hovering the mouse over the Purchase Value (see Figure 3).</p> <p>Figure 3.  Pop-over panel for Purchase value field.</p> <p>The custom period (from 2000, Jan 1 (not included) until 2020, Jan 1 (included) has a Purchase Value of 500 EUR because it contains only the first buy (= 5 * 100 EUR). The second and third buy or not taken into account because they occur later than the period end. Things become more complicated -but with the same logic- when there are also sell transactions. Important to remember is that PP use a FIFO (First In, First OUT) method to calculate the result of a sell transaction. Suppose that you did a (rather bad timed) sell at 2021, Jul 1 2020 of 12 shares (see Figure 4).</p> <p>Figure 4.  Overview and graph of all buy and sell transactions.</p> <p>At that moment there were 15 shares available (5 at 100 EUR and 10 at 90 EUR). Selling 12 of them will first sell the 5 shares of 100 EUR and then another 2 of 90 EUR, leaving 3 shares of 90 EUR available.</p> <p>Now, let's calculate the Purchase Value for the different periods.</p> <ul> <li> <p>1 year period: The period runs from 2022, May 15 until 2023, May 15. All purchases are done before the beginning of the period; so each of them is valued at the price of 2022, May 15, which is 110 EUR. How many shares are available? 5 + 10 - 12 + 15 = 18 at 110 EUR or 1980 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>2 years period running from 2021, May 15 until 2023, May 15. Only the last buy transaction falls within the period and is evaluated at its current quote (110 EUR). The Statement of Assets consists of 3 shares (15 buy - 12 sell). They are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (90 EUR). The Purchase Value for the 2 years period is: 3 * 90 EUR + 15 * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>3 years period running from 2020, May 15 until 2023, May 15. The Statement of Assets is 0 EUR because all 5 shares from buy 1 are sold (FIFO) on 2021, Jul 15. From the second buy, only 3 shares are remaining, evaluated at 90 EUR. The third buy is evaluated at 110 EUR. The Purchase Value of the 3 years period is 3 shares * 90 EUR + 15 shares * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.

In the default view, the Market Value is expressed in EUR. If you wish to view that value in USD instead, you can achieve this by adding the <code>Market Value**</code> field.</p> <p>The <code>Distance to SMA</code> is a metric that measures the difference between the current price of a share and the average price of that share over a specified number of past days. The acronym \"SMA\" presumably represents \"Simple Moving Average.\"</p> <p>When you choose to include this column, you'll also need to specify a period, such as 5 days, 20 days, 50 days, or 200 days.

The calculation is carried out as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Calculate the average price of the last 5 days, including today = (71.96 + ... + 74.50)/5 = 72.88 EUR.</li> <li>Calculate the difference of today's price with the average price = 71.96 - 72.88 = -0.92 EUR.</li> <li>Divide this difference by the average price and convert to a percentage = -0.92/72.88 = -1.26%. The current price (October 5) is 1.26% lower than the average price of the last 5 days.</li> </ol> <p><code>Distance to ATH</code> (All Time High) is a likewise metric that shows how far the current price is from the highest price in the specified period. For example, the highest price of share-1 in the last year was 77.4 EUR. The current price is 71.96 EUR. So the \u0394 ATH 1 year (Distance to ATH for a 1 year period) is equal to (71.96 - 77.4)/77.4 or -7.03%. </p> <p># Available views</p> <p>Using the <code>Reset Columns</code> option in Figure 3, you can revert to the default arrangement of columns.

Buying transaction example for import</p> <p>As you can see in figure 1, the following PP fields are  used: Security Name (share-2), the implied currency (USD), Securities Account (Broker-A), Deposit Account (Broker-A (EUR), Date &amp; time, number of Shares (10), buying quote (5 USD), Gross Amount in USD (50), Exchange Rate (1.0785 EUR/USD), Gross Amount in EUR(46.36), Fees USD and EUR), Taxes (USD and EUR), Value or Debit Note (55.21), and a note (My Note).

Import dialog window with the 5 types</p> <p>The difference between each type is rather nebulous and not very good documented. The following definitions are tentative.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Account Transactions: will be used to register transactions within one account; for example the payment of a dividend (?)</p> </li> <li> <p>Portfolio Transactions: for transactions between accounts. For example, the buying of a share involves adding shares to the Securities account and reducing the associated deposit account with money.</p> </li> <li> <p>Securities: you can use this type to create securities in the All Securities account without also adding a transaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Historical Quotes: to create a table of historical quotes for a security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Securities Account: with this type, you can create new securities within the All Securities account and at the same time a buy transaction in the All Transactions account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each type has required and optional fields. For example, the Historical Quotes type only needs the Date and the Quote.

What about DRIP? A dividend is the payment of a part of the company's profit to its shareholders. Sometimes you can choose to receive this dividend in cash or in shares. But how should you register this latter share dividend.</p> <p>For example, at the annual general meeting of the NN Group, the shareholders approved a final dividend of EUR 1.56. The final dividend will be paid either fully in cash, after deduction of withholding tax if applicable, or fully in ordinary shares, at the election of the shareholders. The following example is about the choice dividend (300 shares) of a Dutch company, paid to a non-resident investor. The dividend is 1.56 EUR/share. The converting ratio is 1 new share for 29.43 old shares. The historical quote at the pay date is 45.91 EUR.</p> <ul> <li> <p>you choose for cash dividend. You receive the net amount of 278.46 EUR. 300 shares * 1.56 EUR = 468 EUR minus foreign taxes (15% or 70.2 EUR), minus fees (0 EUR), minus domestic taxes (30% or 119.34 EUR).</p> </li> <li> <p>You choose for share dividend. You receive 10 shares at 45.91 and 5 cash dividends (6.63 EUR). You have to pay some fees (3.50 EUR) and domestic taxes (140.09 EUR).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Theoretically, there is no difference between the two choices. 300 shares/29.43 * 45.91 ~= 300 shares * 1.56 EUR.</p> <p>In this example, the broker doesn't allow share fractions. So, you only receive 10 additional new shares (not 10.19 shares) for 295 old shares and a pay-out of the remaining 5 old shares dividend.</p> <p>The domestic taxes are much larger for the share dividend (30%) than if you should buy the shares from your cash account(0.35%) (140.09 EUR). Of course, if the dividends are paid in cash, then you would also have paid domestic taxes. Either way, the government receives the same amount.</p> <p>In this particular example, there is a small benefit because there are no foreign taxes (15%) in case of a share dividend.</p> <p>There has been a lot of debate about how to book these transactions in PP. My understanding of the proposed procedure is:</p> <ul> <li>book the dividends for all shares without fees and taxes. These will be paid for in the following step. If your broker doesn't allow for share fractions, you can use one transaction for the share dividend part (e.g. 295 in the example) without fees &amp; taxes and another transaction with taxes and fees for the cash dividend. </li> <li>buy the allocated shares at the same day with the theoretical historical quote and the associated fees and taxes.</li> </ul> <p>Figure 1.  Implementation in PP</p> <p>Please note that in this example the total outflow is much larger the inflow from the dividend payment. This is because the number of reinvested shares is calculated on the gross amount.
