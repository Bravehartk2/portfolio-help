Because all purchases fall before the reporting period, the value for each of them is taken from the beginning of the period. At that time (2022, May 15), the share was valued at a quote of 110 EUR (see graph). So, the total purchase value is 30 shares * 110 = 3300 EUR. This is the beginning situation of the period (also called Statement of Assets). Since, there are no purchases afterwards, this amount is also the purchase value of the 1 year period.</p> <p>The 2 years period starts at 2021, May 15. Only the third buy falls within the period. So, buy 1 and buy 2 are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (= 90 EUR). So, the Statement of Assets equals 1350 EUR. There is one buy afterwards (valued at the buying quote). The total Purchase Value of this 2 year period is therefore (5 + 10) shares at 90 EUR + 15 shares at 110 EUR or 1350 +1650 = 3000 EUR.</p> <p>The 3 years period start at 2020, May 15. The second and third buy lie within the reporting period and are evaluated at their respective quotes: 10 shares at 90 EUR (= 900 EUR) and 15 shares at 110 EUR (= 1650 EUR). The beginning of the period or Statement of Assets is the result of the first buy (2020, Jan 1) takes the quote from the beginning of the period (2020, May 15) which is the same as the purchase quote (e.g. 100 EUR); resulting in a purchase of 5 * 100 EUR = 500 EUR.</p> <p>The previous explanation can be seen in the pop-over, when hovering the mouse over the Purchase Value (see Figure 3).</p> <p>Figure 3.

Important to remember is that PP use a FIFO (First In, First OUT) method to calculate the result of a sell transaction.

Only the last buy transaction falls within the period and is evaluated at its current quote (110 EUR). The Statement of Assets consists of 3 shares (15 buy - 12 sell). They are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (90 EUR). The Purchase Value for the 2 years period is: 3 * 90 EUR + 15 * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>3 years period running from 2020, May 15 until 2023, May 15. The Statement of Assets is 0 EUR because all 5 shares from buy 1 are sold (FIFO) on 2021, Jul 15. From the second buy, only 3 shares are remaining, evaluated at 90 EUR. The third buy is evaluated at 110 EUR. The Purchase Value of the 3 years period is 3 shares * 90 EUR + 15 shares * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.

For example, your portfolio starts at 100 EUR and grows to 120 EUR by the end of the period, resulting in a performance of + 20%. Equation 1 offers two versions of the base formula; also named the Simple Rate of Return (ROR).</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{r = \\frac{(MVE - MVB)}{MVB} \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad 1 + r = \\frac{MVE}{MVB} \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad MVE = MVB \\times (1 + r) \\quad (Eq  1)}$$</p> <p>where MVE = the market value of the portfolio at the end of the reporting period, and MVB = the market value of the portfolio at the beginning of the period. Please note that:</p> <ul> <li>The rate of return percentage applies to the entire period (3 years, 6 months, ...) and is not an annual rate.</li> <li>There are no additional transactions within this specified period.</li> </ul> <p>To address these concerns, PP employs two distinct approaches to calculate the rate of return when additional transactions occur within the reporting period: the money-weighted or time-weighted rate of return. It also differentiates between measuring performance on the portfolio, security, or trade level.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The simple Rate of Return (ROR) isn't adequate for describing the performance of a portfolio when transactions occur in the reporting period. For instance, suppose your portfolio already contains one share valued at 100 EUR at the beginning of the year (MVB=100); an empty portfolio would pose even more problems due to dividing by zero in Equation 1. Thanks to the favorable  track record of the company issuing the share, its price increases to 104 EUR per share at the end of the year. Let's now compare the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>No additional transactions: you do nothing. According to Equation 1, r = (104-100)/100 = 4%. This seems intuitive correct. You gained 4 EUR, which is 4% of the initial value.</li> <li>Additional transactions: you acquire  a second share at 100 EUR; right at the beginning of the year. MVB is still 100 EUR; while MVE becomes 2 * 104 = 208 EUR. The performance becomes a staggering 108% or (208-100)/100. This does not feel OK. You know that the growth rate of the company's share is 4%. Certainly, your total investment of 200\u20ac has gained 8 EUR or 4% on 200 EUR; but not on the MVB of 100 EUR. The additional transaction has distorted the simple rate of return formula.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"concepts/performance/#the-money-weighted-rate-of-return","title":"The money-weighted rate of return","text":"<p>The money-weighted rate of return (MWR) employs the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) technique commonly used in project management.

This calculation considers both the timing (when) and the amount (how much) of the cash flows within the reporting period. A cash flow is any amount of money that is added to or withdrawn from a portfolio. The base formula for the IRR calculation is:</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{MVE = MVB \\times (1 + IRR)^{\\frac{RD_1}{365}} + \\sum_{t=1} ^{n}CF_t \\times (1+IRR)^{\\frac{RD_t}{365}} \\qquad \\text{(Eq 1)}}$$</p> <p>where n = the number of cash flows in the reporting period, $CF_t$ = cash flow at time t within the period, and $RD_t$ = the number of remaining days within the period. For MVB, the $RD_1$ equals the entire period, represented in days. To annualize the return rate, you need to divide the remaining days by 365. To calculate the periodic return rate, divide by the number of days of the period. For example</p> <p>The formula is very similar to the calculation of Future Value. With an interest rate of 5%, 100 EUR today will be worth 115.76 EUR in three years or <code>100 x (1 +0.05)^3</code>. Since PP uses days as standard period, we need to divide the remaining number of days that the cash flow could influence the performance by 365 to obtain a decimal representation of the yearly period. $\\mathrm{CF_t \\times (1+IRR)^{\\frac{RD_t}{365}}}$ is thus the expected future value of the cash flow CF at time t by the the end of the period with an annual interest rate = IRR. Please note that in the absence of any cash flows, Equation 1 resembles the simple return formula MVE = MVB x (1 + r).</p> <p>The IRR is the annual interest rate that is necessary to bring the beginning value of the investment (MVB) and all subsequent cash flows to the end value (MVE). To produce the specified cash flows within the given time period, your portfolio needs to grow each year by a percentage equal to the Internal Rate of Return (IRR).</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In project management literature, you are more likely to encounter Equation 1 expressed as:</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}}+\\frac{CF_{t2}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_2}{365}}+...+ \\frac{CF_{tn}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_n}{365}}}$$</p> <p>where $\\mathrm{CF_{t0}}$ denotes the initial cash outflow at time $t_0$, representing your initial investment. $\\mathrm{CF_{t1} \\cdots CF_{tn}}$ are the net cashflows that your initial investment will yield. PP works with daily periods instead of the traditional annual periods. Therefore, $\\mathrm{t_1, t_2, \\cdots t_n}$ should be converted to the number of days between start of the period and the cash flow.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to derive the value of IRR from Equation 1.

Key performance and risk indicators for the entire portfolio are summarized in a dashboard, accessible through the menu <code>View &gt; Reports &gt; Performance</code> or via the sidebar (see Figure 1). A comprehensive review of the dashboard is available in the Reference Manual under <code>View &gt; Performance</code>. As always, green values indicate a profit, while red signifies a loss.</p> <p>Figure 1.  Dashboard with key performance indicators - 2-year reporting period.</p> <p>To follow along with the text and Figure 2, download the demo-portfolio-03 file. We begin by examining the Calculation Widget (on the right side).</p> <ul> <li>Reporting period Select the 2-years reporting period from <code>2021-06-12</code> \u2192 <code>2023-06-12</code>. This implicates that your portfolio already contained some stock by June 12, 2021.</li> <li>Initial value This is the market value of the portfolio at the beginning of the reporting period (MVB), e.g. 177.94 EUR. At that day, your portfolio held 10 <code>share-1</code> valued at 17.79 EUR per share, totaling 177.94 EUR (look here for an overview of all transactions in the demo portfolio). Please note, that the historical price of the stock is taken, not the original buying price.</li> <li>Final value This is the market value of the portfolio at the end of the reporting period; e.g. 426.82 EUR. To verify the final value, navigate to <code>sidebar &gt; Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Calculation</code> and click on the <code>Assets at End</code> heading tab. The deposit account shows 125 EUR from dividend and sell transactions. <code>share-1</code> is valued at 190.06 EUR (10 remaining shares x 19.06), and <code>share-2</code> at 111.76 (8 shares x 13.97). In total, this sums to 426.62 EUR, representing the<code>Final (market value)</code>of your portfolio on June 12, 2023. However, note that this value includes the deposits made to purchase the stock, which should be excluded.     As you can see, the final value is almost equal to the sum of the items above.</li> <li>Performance neutral Transfers These are the deposits (external cash flows) you made in order to buy the assets. As can be seen from the transactions list, this is 84 EUR (additional <code>share-1</code>), and 67 EUR (<code>share-2</code>). Note that the original purchase of <code>share-1</code> (155 EUR) is not included because it felt outside the reporting period.</li> <li>Capital Gains represent the increase (or decrease) of the value of your stock between begin and end of the reporting period. Determining the buying value of <code>share-1</code> is somewhat complex due to the additional buy and sale. PP follows the FIFO (First-In-First-out) principle. From the remaining 10 shares, 5 will come from the first purchase and 5 from the second purchase. The historical quote at the first purchase date was 17.794 EUR/share and at the second purchase data 15.962 given an average price of (17.794 + 15.962)/2 = 16.878 EUR. The final market value is 19.006 EUR given a capital gain of 10 x (19.006-16.878) = 21.28 EUR. The value of <code>share-2</code> has increased from 8 EUR (at 2022-09-30) to 13.97 (at 2023-06-12) or 8 x 5.97 = 47.76 EUR. Added together gives a total Capital Gain of 69.04 EUR.</li> <li>Realized Capital Gains are the result of selling stock. Op <code>2023-04-12</code> you sold 5 <code>share-1</code> at 22.40 EUR/share. Given FIFO principle this gives a buying price of 17.794 EUR/share and produces a Realized Capital Gain of 5 x (22.40 - 17.794) = 23.03 EUR.  -Earnings is caused by dividend payments (15 x 2 = 30 EUR), while Fees and Taxes encompass all fees and taxes incurred in the reporting period. Keep in mind that fees and taxes were also paid for the purchase of <code>share-1</code>, outside the reporting period.</li> <li>Absolute Change The difference between the final and initial value; e.g. 426.82 - 177.94 = 248.88 EUR. In this case, you earned a profit: your portfolio is more worth than it was in the beginning. Note that this profit includes the investments or external cash inflows you made to buy additional shares.</li> <li>Delta (for the reporting period) is equal to the <code>Absolute Change</code> minus the <code>Performance neutral Transfers</code>, resulting in 97.88 EUR. You might be tempted to think that Delta should be equal to the sum of all sub calculations (Capital Gains + Realize Capital Gains, ...). As you may noted however, the numbers in the calculation panel do not add up; e.g. Final value &lt;&gt; Initial value + ... Otherwise, you would have counted some elements twice. For example, the result of the dividend and sale is put on a deposit account and as such already included in both the Realized Capital Gains and Earnings and also in the post Performance Neutral Transfers.</li> <li>Internal Rate of Return (IRR) stands at 17.63%. This is the annual interest rate required to bring the initial market value of 177.94 EUR and all subsequent cash flows of 151 EUR to the final market value of 426.82 EUR. Therefore, the IRR is a percentage illustrating how well your portfolio performs, considering when and how much money you've invested or withdrawn (more info here).</li> <li>Cumulative True Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TTWOR) is 25.58%. It represents the growth rate of your portfolio from 177.94 EUR to 426.82 EUR, excluding external cash flows. TTWOR measures the growth of your investments without being influenced by the timing and size of your contributions or withdrawals (more info here).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/manage-portfolio/","title":"Manage your portfolio","text":"<p>If you've been following the steps outlined in the \"Getting Started\" chapter, you'll likely have noticed that your portfolio is still devoid of any securities.

Buying transaction example for import</p> <p>As you can see in figure 1, the following PP fields are  used: Security Name (share-2), the implied currency (USD), Securities Account (Broker-A), Deposit Account (Broker-A (EUR), Date &amp; time, number of Shares (10), buying quote (5 USD), Gross Amount in USD (50), Exchange Rate (1.0785 EUR/USD), Gross Amount in EUR(46.36), Fees USD and EUR), Taxes (USD and EUR), Value or Debit Note (55.21), and a note (My Note).

A CSV file is simply a text file. The first line contains the names of the fields (columns); separated by commas. The second and following lines contain the data, also separated by commas. For example, the following print-out of a CSV-file contains three fields or columns and two lines of data.</p> <pre><code>Name,Type,Date,Value\nShare-1,dividend,2023-05-21,1500\nShare-2,buy,2023-06-01, 20\n</code></pre> <p>PP distinguishes between 5 types of import: Account Transactions, Portfolio Transactions, Securities, Historical Quotes, and Securities Account (see figure 2). To correctly use a type and import the data into PP, the CSV file must contain specific fields. Depending on the type of account, there are other required and optional fields.</p> <p>Figure 2.  Import dialog window with the 5 types</p> <p>The difference between each type is rather nebulous and not very good documented. The following definitions are tentative.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Account Transactions: will be used to register transactions within one account; for example the payment of a dividend (?)</p> </li> <li> <p>Portfolio Transactions: for transactions between accounts. For example, the buying of a share involves adding shares to the Securities account and reducing the associated deposit account with money.</p> </li> <li> <p>Securities: you can use this type to create securities in the All Securities account without also adding a transaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Historical Quotes: to create a table of historical quotes for a security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Securities Account: with this type, you can create new securities within the All Securities account and at the same time a buy transaction in the All Transactions account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each type has required and optional fields. For example, the Historical Quotes type only needs the Date and the Quote.

What about DRIP? A dividend is the payment of a part of the company's profit to its shareholders. Sometimes you can choose to receive this dividend in cash or in shares. But how should you register this latter share dividend.</p> <p>For example, at the annual general meeting of the NN Group, the shareholders approved a final dividend of EUR 1.56. The final dividend will be paid either fully in cash, after deduction of withholding tax if applicable, or fully in ordinary shares, at the election of the shareholders. The following example is about the choice dividend (300 shares) of a Dutch company, paid to a non-resident investor. The dividend is 1.56 EUR/share. The converting ratio is 1 new share for 29.43 old shares. The historical quote at the pay date is 45.91 EUR.</p> <ul> <li> <p>you choose for cash dividend. You receive the net amount of 278.46 EUR. 300 shares * 1.56 EUR = 468 EUR minus foreign taxes (15% or 70.2 EUR), minus fees (0 EUR), minus domestic taxes (30% or 119.34 EUR).</p> </li> <li> <p>You choose for share dividend. You receive 10 shares at 45.91 and 5 cash dividends (6.63 EUR). You have to pay some fees (3.50 EUR) and domestic taxes (140.09 EUR).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Theoretically, there is no difference between the two choices. 300 shares/29.43 * 45.91 ~= 300 shares * 1.56 EUR.</p> <p>In this example, the broker doesn't allow share fractions. So, you only receive 10 additional new shares (not 10.19 shares) for 295 old shares and a pay-out of the remaining 5 old shares dividend.</p> <p>The domestic taxes are much larger for the share dividend (30%) than if you should buy the shares from your cash account(0.35%) (140.09 EUR). Of course, if the dividends are paid in cash, then you would also have paid domestic taxes. Either way, the government receives the same amount.</p> <p>In this particular example, there is a small benefit because there are no foreign taxes (15%) in case of a share dividend.</p> <p>There has been a lot of debate about how to book these transactions in PP. My understanding of the proposed procedure is:</p> <ul> <li>book the dividends for all shares without fees and taxes. These will be paid for in the following step. If your broker doesn't allow for share fractions, you can use one transaction for the share dividend part (e.g. 295 in the example) without fees &amp; taxes and another transaction with taxes and fees for the cash dividend. </li> <li>buy the allocated shares at the same day with the theoretical historical quote and the associated fees and taxes.</li> </ul> <p>Figure 1.  Implementation in PP</p> <p>Please note that in this example the total outflow is much larger the inflow from the dividend payment. This is because the number of reinvested shares is calculated on the gross amount. So, all taxes and fees are in surplus of this choice dividend.</p>"},{"location":"reference/","title":"Reference Manual","text":"<p>The Reference manual is structured around the User Interface (UI) of the program, probably the easiest and quickest way for users, developers, or contributors to find relevant information.

The required attribute for that website will be automatically embedded in the URL, guiding you to the appropriate webpage on the financial site.</p> <p>The list contains several examples. On the forum, many more are suggested along with some workarounds.</p> <p>Using the <code>New Bookmark</code> icon (top right), you can add custom bookmarks for your personal situation. A line named \"New Bookmark\" is added to the list with the URL <code>http://example.net/{tickerSymbol}?isin={isin}&amp;wkn={wkn}&amp;name={name}</code> (see Figure 1, last line). Double click name or URL to change the value. You need to inspect the original website to figure out how to form a correct URL. For example, finance.yahoo.com requires a URL like https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA to retrieve the webpage of NVIDIA. Using the placeholder {tickerSymbol}, the URL will be dynamically populated with the appropriate symbol for the chosen security during runtime.</p> <p>Figure 2.  Context menu of the bookmarks page.</p> <p>The available placeholders are listed in the context menu (accessible via right-click) on the bookmarks page under the \"Insert replacement\" option (see figure 2): {isin}, {name}, {wkn}, {tickersymbol}, and {tickersymbolprefix}. In the ticker format XXX.YY (for instance, DTE.DE), XXX corresponds to {tickersymbolprefix}, and xxx.YY represents {tickersymbol}. For some websites, you may need only the {tickersymbolprefix}.</p> <p>With this pontext menu, you can manage the bookmark list.</p> <ul> <li>Open in browser: a second pop-up displays all available securities; this could be a very long, unsorted list. Opening a webpage from a selected security within the <code>All securties</code> view is a better approach. -Move up: moves a bookmark one line up in the list; for example to sort the bookmarks in a particular order.</li> <li>Insert before and Insert after: using the new bookmark icon (see further) will append it at the end of the list. Using these options enable the placement of a new bookmark before or after the selected one.</li> <li>Add separator: inserts a blank line after the selected bookmark.</li> <li>Insert replacement: displays an additional pop-up with the available placeholders.  The selected placeholder will be append at the end of the URL. Please note that you can separate placeholders with a comma, indicating that the first available placeholder (in the website) should be used.</li> <li>Delete: removes a bookmark from the list.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/view/settings/#attributes-securities","title":"Attributes: Securities","text":"<p>New attributes or fields can be defined for Securities (see Figure 2), Deposit Accounts, Security Accounts, and Investment plans.

Many more columns/fields are available (see Figure 3). While the column headings are mostly self-explanatory, a few of them may require further clarification. You can customize the default columns using the gear icon located in the top-right corner (see Figure 2).</p> <p>The abbreviation \"MA\" that follows Purchase Price/Value stands for \"Moving Average\" but in fact it should be better called WA or \"Weighted Average\". As mentioned in the discussion about Purchase Value, PP uses the FIFO (First-in, First-out) method to calculate prices and values. \"Moving/weighted average\", however, is another commonly used method.</p> <p>The Purchase Price and the Purchase Price (MA) of <code>share-1</code> are respectively 44.41 EUR and 51.61 EUR; a rather big difference. Why? From Figure 2:</p> <ul> <li>Purchase of 50 shares at 58.82 EUR on December 14, 2020.</li> <li>Purchase of 30 shares at 39.60 EUR on September 29, 2022.</li> <li>Sale of 40 shares at 72.48 EUR on September 28, 2023.</li> </ul> <p>What is the Purchase Price of the remaining 40 shares in the portfolio?</p> <ul> <li>The moving/weighted average method states that the average price of the original 80 shares was ((50 x 58.82) + (30 x 39.60))/80 = 51.6125 EUR. The remaining 40 shares are valuated at this price.</li> <li>The FIFO method asserts that the remaining 40 shares are composed of 10 shares of the first purchase and 30 shares of the second purchase. The average price is thus ((10 x 58.82) + (30 x 39.60))/40 = 44.405 EUR.</li> </ul> <p>The available fields under <code>Performance</code> and <code>Dividends</code> are discussed in a separate chapter.</p> <p>With the <code>Attributes</code> option, you can add custom fields to the table. These fields are defined in <code>left sidebar &gt; settings &gt; Attributes: Securities</code> and following panels. You can enter a specific attribute value for a security in the <code>Additional attributes</code> panel of the security (see for example, Figure 3 in Getting started &gt; Adding securities)</p> <p>The <code>Forex</code> (Foreign Exchange) option allows you to view the currency of the quote for each asset and its exchange rate relative to the base currency of the portfolio. The fields labeled as <code>Market value**</code>, <code>Purchase Price**</code>, and <code>Profit/Loss**</code> retain the same meaning as their counterparts in the base currency, but they are presented in the foreign currency.</p> <p>For instance, let's consider <code>share-2</code>, which is traded in USD. In the default view, the Market Value is expressed in EUR. If you wish to view that value in USD instead, you can achieve this by adding the <code>Market Value**</code> field.</p> <p>The <code>Distance to SMA</code> is a metric that measures the difference between the current price of a share and the average price of that share over a specified number of past days. The acronym \"SMA\" presumably represents \"Simple Moving Average.\"</p> <p>When you choose to include this column, you'll also need to specify a period, such as 5 days, 20 days, 50 days, or 200 days. Suppose that you want to know the \u0394 to SMA5 (Distance to SMA for a 5 days period) of <code>share-1</code>. The last 5 available prices are: 71.96, 72.00, 72.42, 73.52, and 74.50 EUR; including the latest available on October, 5 (= 71.96 EUR). The calculation is carried out as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Calculate the average price of the last 5 days, including today = (71.96 + ... + 74.50)/5 = 72.88 EUR.</li> <li>Calculate the difference of today's price with the average price = 71.96 - 72.88 = -0.92 EUR.</li> <li>Divide this difference by the average price and convert to a percentage = -0.92/72.88 = -1.26%. The current price (October 5) is 1.26% lower than the average price of the last 5 days.</li> </ol> <p><code>Distance to ATH</code> (All Time High) is a likewise metric that shows how far the current price is from the highest price in the specified period. For example, the highest price of share-1 in the last year was 77.4 EUR. The current price is 71.96 EUR. So the \u0394 ATH 1 year (Distance to ATH for a 1 year period) is equal to (71.96 - 77.4)/77.4 or -7.03%. </p> <p># Available views</p> <p>Using the <code>Reset Columns</code> option in Figure 3, you can revert to the default arrangement of columns.
