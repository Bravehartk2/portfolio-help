PP uses several terms to indicate the concept of account: Securities, Deposit, Reference, Cash, Offset, ... account. What do they mean and in what aspects do they differ?</li> <li>Transaction: A financial transaction is an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. In case of PP, the exchange is about securities. There are security transactions such as buy, sell delivery (inbound), and delivery (outbound); deposit transactions such as deposit, removal, interest, interest charge, fees, fees refund, taxes, tax refund; and dividend transactions.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"concepts/account/","title":"Types of accounts!","text":"<p>An account is a collection of transactions. These could be buy and sell transactions of securities (shares, \u2026) in case of a Securities account or the withdrawal and deposit of money for a Deposit account.

As part of the installation procedure, you should already have created at least one Securities account and one Deposit account.</p> <p>PP has two main type accounts: Securities and Deposit accounts. They are rather well described in the Guide on getting started of Thomas (Contributor); you have to scroll quite a bit down.</p> <p>Other related terms are \u201cInvestment Plans\u201d, \u201cAll Transactions\u201d, \u201cReference account\u201d and \u201cOffset account\u201d.

They will be used for deposits and withdrawals in EUR or USD. It's a bit redundant to call them \u201cEUR\u201d and \u201cUSD\u201d because you also have to specify the currency that the account will use (see third column in figure). Then, for example, when you want to book a dividend in EUR, you will get the following dialog. The cash account can be selected from a drop-down and the correct currency is automatically added.</p> <p></p> Figure 2: Deposit Account with redundant Currency <p>According to your needs, you can use other names. For example, if you want to collect all of your dividends or taxes in a separate account, you could name them \u201cDividends\u201d and \u201cTaxes\u201d in stead of EUR and USD. Of course, you also have to decide which currency that will be used for them. And, if you receive dividends in both EUR and USD then you need two deposit accounts with the name \u201cDividends\u201d but with different currencies.</p> <p>Another possibility is to name the deposit accounts with the name of the bank or broker they belong to; e.g. BNPPF, Deutsche Bank, \u2026</p> <p>A deposit account is used to transfer or receive money as the result of a transaction. In figure\u00a01 (bottom part), 4 buy/sell transactions result in a negative balance (-2210 EUR).

Suppose, you want to import the following transaction.</p> <p> Fig 1: Buying transaction example for import </p> <p>As you can see in figure 1, the following PP fields are  used: Security Name (share-2), the implied currency (USD), Securities Account (Broker-A), Deposit Account (Broker-A (EUR), Date &amp; time, number of Shares (10), buying quote (5 USD), Gross Amount in USD (50), Exchange Rate (1.0785 EUR/USD), Gross Amount in EUR(46.36), Fees USD and EUR), Taxes (USD and EUR), Value or Debit Note (55.21), and a note (My Note).

The following definitions are tentative.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Account Transactions: will be used to register transactions within one account; for example the payment of a dividend (?)</p> </li> <li> <p>Portfolio Transactions: for transactions between accounts. For example, the buying of a share involves adding shares to the Securities account and reducing the associated deposit account with money.</p> </li> <li> <p>Securities: you can use this type to create securities in the All Securities account without also adding a transaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Historical Quotes: to create a table of historical quotes for a security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Securities Account: with this type, you can create new securities within the All Securities account and at the same time a buy transaction in the All Transactions account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each type has required and optional fields. For example, the Historical Quotes type only needs the Date and the Quote. Instead of repeating the name of the share again and again for each date, you can select the security in the next pop-up window. The Account Transactions type has two required Fields: Value and Date.
