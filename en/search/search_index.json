Because all purchases fall before the reporting period, the value for each of them is taken from the beginning of the period. At that time (2022, May 15), the share was valued at a quote of 110 EUR (see graph). So, the total purchase value is 30 shares * 110 = 3300 EUR. This is the beginning situation of the period (also called Statement of Assets). Since, there are no purchases afterwards, this amount is also the purchase value of the 1 year period.</p> <p>The 2 years period starts at 2021, May 15. Only the third buy falls within the period. So, buy 1 and buy 2 are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (= 90 EUR). So, the Statement of Assets equals 1350 EUR. There is one buy afterwards (valued at the buying quote). The total Purchase Value of this 2 year period is therefore (5 + 10) shares at 90 EUR + 15 shares at 110 EUR or 1350 +1650 = 3000 EUR.</p> <p>The 3 years period start at 2020, May 15. The second and third buy lie within the reporting period and are evaluated at their respective quotes: 10 shares at 90 EUR (= 900 EUR) and 15 shares at 110 EUR (= 1650 EUR). The beginning of the period or Statement of Assets is the result of the first buy (2020, Jan 1) takes the quote from the beginning of the period (2020, May 15) which is the same as the purchase quote (e.g. 100 EUR); resulting in a purchase of 5 * 100 EUR = 500 EUR.</p> <p>The previous explanation can be seen in the pop-over, when hovering the mouse over the Purchase Value (see Figure 3).</p> <p>Figure 3.

Important to remember is that PP use a FIFO (First In, First OUT) method to calculate the result of a sell transaction.

Only the last buy transaction falls within the period and is evaluated at its current quote (110 EUR). The Statement of Assets consists of 3 shares (15 buy - 12 sell). They are evaluated at the price from the beginning of the period (90 EUR). The Purchase Value for the 2 years period is: 3 * 90 EUR + 15 * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.</p> </li> <li> <p>3 years period running from 2020, May 15 until 2023, May 15. The Statement of Assets is 0 EUR because all 5 shares from buy 1 are sold (FIFO) on 2021, Jul 15. From the second buy, only 3 shares are remaining, evaluated at 90 EUR. The third buy is evaluated at 110 EUR. The Purchase Value of the 3 years period is 3 shares * 90 EUR + 15 shares * 110 EUR = 1920 EUR.

Whether you invest one EUR or 100 EUR, you will achieve the same return. The reporting period is divided into several holding periods, and for each holding period, a return value is calculated and then compounded into an overall return. Each period carries equal weight; hence the name time-weighted rate of return. In the True Time-Weighted Rate Of Return methodology (TTWROR), performance is calculated using simple returns without any consideration for the total amount invested.</p> <p>The TTWOR method is explained in depth in the time-weighted section of this chapter.</p> <p>A nice video about the calculation and difference between money-weighted and time-weighted approach is given by the following CFA-level-1 exam video.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/performance/money-weighted/","title":"The money-weighted rate of return","text":"<p>The money-weighted rate of return is in fact identical to the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) technique used in project management. This calculation considers both the timing (when) and the amount (how much) of money moves into and out of the portfolio within the reporting period. The base formula for the IRR calculation is:</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{MVE = MVB \\times (1 + IRR)^{\\frac{RD_1}{365}} + \\sum_{t=1} ^{n}CF_t \\times (1+IRR)^{\\frac{RD_t}{365}} \\qquad \\text{(Eq 1)}}$$</p> <p>where n = the number of cash flows in the reporting period, $CF_t$ = cash flow at time t within the period, and $RD_t$ = the number of remaining days within the period. For MVB, the $RD_t$ equals the entire period, representing the period length in years. You can simplify the equation by treating the MVB as the initial cash flow. A cash flow is any amount of money that is added to or withdrawn from an investment.</p> <p>The formula is very similar to the calculation of Future Value. With an interest rate of 5%, 100 EUR today will be worth 115.76 EUR in three years or <code>100 x (1 +0.05)^3</code>. Since PP uses days as standard period, we need to divide the remaining number of days that the cash flow could influence the performance by 365 to obtain a decimal representation of the yearly period. $\\mathrm{CF_t \\times (1+IRR)^{\\frac{RD_t}{365}}}$ is thus the expected future value of the cash flow CF at time t by the the end of the period with an annual interest rate = IRR. Please note that in the absence of any cash flows, Equation (1) resembles the simple return formula MVE = MVB x (1 + r). The added exponent transforms the return rate into an annual rate of return rather than a periodic rate of return, as in the simple return formula.</p> <p>The IRR is the annual interest rate that is necessary to bring the beginning value of the investment (MVB) and all subsequent cash flows to the end value (MVE). To produce the specified cash flows within the given time period, your portfolio needs to grow each year by a percentage equal to the Internal Rate of Return (IRR).</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In project management literature, you are more likely to encounter Equation (1) expressed as:</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{CF_{t0} = \\frac{CF_{t1}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_1}{365}}+\\frac{CF_{t2}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_2}{365}}+...+ \\frac{CF_{tn}}{(1 + IRR)^\\frac{t_n}{365}}}$$</p> <p>where $\\mathrm{CF_{t0}}$ denotes the initial cash outflow at time $t_0$, representing your initial investment. $\\mathrm{CF_{t1} \\cdots CF_{tn}}$ are the net cashflows that your initial investment will yield.

Therefore, $\\mathrm{t_1, t_2, \\cdots t_n}$ should be converted to the number of days between $t_0$ and $t_n$.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to derive the value of IRR from Equation 1.

For each holding period, a return value is calculated and then compounded into an overall return. Each period carries equal weight; hence the name time-weighted rate of return. In the True Time-Weighted Rate Of Return methodology (TTWROR), performance is calculated using simple returns without any consideration for the total amount invested.</p> <p>To minimize the computational effort, older methods utilized larger holding periods. A natural marker could be the dates of each cash flow.  The holding periods would be formed by: <code>Period Start --&gt; CF1, CF1 --&gt; CF2, CF2 --&gt; CF3, ..., CFn-1 --&gt; Period end</code>. A holding period starts at period start or immediately before a cash flow and ends just before the following cash flow or the period end: CF1 is included in HP1 but CF2 isn't. If any cash flow exists outside the reporting period, making the Market Value Begin &gt; 0, then the first holding period must start at the beginning of the reporting period. Otherwise, the first period starts with the first CF. Figure 1 illustrates the various concepts, applied to our demo-portfolio-03, with a three-year reporting period, making MVB = 0.</p> <p>Figure 1.  Calculation of True Time-Weighted Rate of Return.</p> <p>For every holding period, the return rate is computed using Equation 1.</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{r = \\frac{MV_t}{MV_{t-1} + CF_t} - 1 \\qquad \\text{(Eq 1)}}$$</p> <p>where $MV_t$ = the market value of the portfolio at the end of holding period t, $MV_{t-1}$ = the market value of the previous holding period.  $CF_t$ is the incoming (positive) or outgoing (negative) cashflow in that period.</p> <p>The return rate is thus corrected for the cashflow, occurring in that period. If the cash flow is incoming or positive, the MVB of the period is increased by it making the performance independent of the cash flow. For example, suppose that MV1 = 100, CF2 = 200, MV2 = 300 for a certain holding period. Without the correcting mechanism, the return would be calculated at 300% while in fact your portfolio hasn't changed and the performance should be 0%.</p> <p>Please note that for  for each holding period, you require the market value of the portfolio twice: once at the end of the previous holding period and once at the end of the current one. </p> <p>After calculating the return rates of each period, they are compounded with the following formula.</p> <p>$$\\mathrm{r = [(1 + r_1) \\times (1 + r_2) \\times (1 + r_3) \\cdots (1 + r_{n-1}) \\times (1 + r_n)] - 1 \\qquad \\text{Eq  2}}$$</p> <p>where $r_t$ is the return rate from holding period t.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/performance/time-weighted/#ttwror-at-portfolio-level","title":"TTWROR at portfolio level","text":"<p>Our demo-portfolio-03.xml has three cash flows (see Figure 1). Because all cash flows fall within the reporting period, the first period (<code>Period start --&gt; CF1</code>)could be omitted. The market value is zero at both the beginning and end of the period.</p> <p>The market value is the sum of the value of all deposit and securities accounts. To determine the value of a security, the (historical) closing price is taken. A cashflow can be positive (inbound transfer) or negative (outbound transfer); assuming that fresh money is added at the beginning of the day (and hence is available to generate return) and removed at the end of the day.</p> <p>For each period, you need $MV_{t-1}$ and the current $MV_{t}$ period. Because the market value is determined at the end of the trading day (closing price), $MV_{t-1}$ is also the value immediately before the cashflow at the beginning of the day.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>One could argue that, as we are required to add the cash flow to $MV_{t-1}$ (as per Equation 1), an alternative approach is to consider the market value of $MV_{t}$, which already includes this cash flow. However, it's important to note that throughout the day, market forces may cause fluctuations in $MV_{t-1}$, and these variations should be excluded when determining the market value at the beginning of the day, just before the cash flow.</p> <p>Manually calculating these portfolio market values can be a tedious task. It involves multiplying the number of shares for each security by the historical price and then adding fees and other relevant factors. But in PP, you can also generate a spreadsheet for all days in the reporting period with these values (see below).</p> <p>Figure 2.  Manual calculation of cumulative and annual TTWROR.</p> <p>As can be seen in Figure 2 [download workbook], the market value at the beginning of the HP1 is zero EUR (= the closing value of the previous period) and 160.26 at the end (immediately before the next cash flow). There was one inbound positive cashflow of 155 EUR, necessary for buying 10 shares of <code>share-1</code>. The return of this period = 160.26/(0 +155) = 3.39%. Thus, eliminating the effect of the incoming cash flow, your portfolio has grown with 3.39% during this holding period of 364 days.</p> <p>Compounding these individual periodical returns into one portfolio return for the whole portfolio with Equation 2 results in a cumulative performance of 44.16%.</p> <p>Since computer time is inexpensive nowadays, there's no need to define long holding periods to minimize manual computation. Therefore, PP employs a single day as the holding period. You can export a file with daily portfolio. Select the menu <code>View &gt; Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Chart</code> and click the icon (top right) <code>Export Data as CSV</code>. Choose <code>Export Entire Portfolio</code> (see Figure 3 for an example).</p> <p>The calculation is analogous to the explanation for manual calculation using longer holding periods. Before <code>2021-01-15</code>, all values are zero, as the first transaction occurred on that day. The <code>Delta in %</code> is equivalent to the value of r in the manual calculation. The formula is slightly different: <code>(MV_t + Outbound Transfer)/(MV_t-1 + Inbound transfer)</code>. The market value at the end of the period (day) is increased by all outbound transfers, such as withdrawals. In the manual calculation, a separate transfer would be used for this purpose.</p> <p>Figure 3.  Export TTWROR data from PP.</p> <p>It's important to highlight that the performance for '2021-01-15' is negative. This is the result of the market value of the portfolio being smaller at that moment than the required cash flow, owing to the taxes and fees associated with acquiring the security. Fortunately, the subsequent market rally has led to a cumulative performance increase to 3.39%, aligning precisely with the manually calculated value for the first holding period.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"Getting started","text":"<p>In order for you to be able to track, evaluate and manage your securities, Portfolio Performance needs the basic data about your securities accounts and past transactions.

The Absolute Change is 426.82 EUR. Take a look at the Calculation panel on the right side. The initial value of your portfolio as of June 12, 2020 was zero EURO and the final value is 426.82 EUR, which, of course, equals the absolute change. You can check the final value with <code>sidebar &gt; Reports &gt; Performance &gt; Calculation</code>. Click at the <code>Assets at End</code> heading tab. As you can see, there is 125 EUR in the deposit account from the dividend and sell transactions. <code>share-1</code> is valuated at 190.06 EUR (10 shares remaining x 19.06) and <code>share-2</code> at 111.76 (8 shares x 13.97). Taken together, this sums to 426.62 EUR, which represents the market value of your portfolio on June 12, 2023.</p> <p>The Delta (for reporting period) is 120.82 EUR. This value represents the actual return of <code>share-1</code> and <code>share-2</code>. The final portfolio value of 426.82 EUR is partly caused by external cash inflows of 155 EUR and 84 EUR to buy <code>share-1</code> and 67 EUR to buy <code>share-2</code>. This money comes from an external source and should be subtracted from the Absolute change. They are summarized as Performance neutral Transfers in the calculation panel.</p> <p>The Absolute change of the Last Day is negative (red). It remains the same for each reporting period. Hovering over the label gives some info. This value is the absolute change for a Reporting period of 1 trading day. Unfortunately, it's not the last day of the chosen reporting period; e.g. 11-12 Jun 2023, but the last trading day before 'today'.</p> <p>What about the True Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TTWOR) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) indices? The IRR is a percentage that shows how well your portfolio performs, considering when and how much money you have put in or take out. TTWOR measure the growth of your investments without being influenced by the timing and size of your contributions or withdrawals. An in-depth explanation of both measurements is given at Concepts &gt; Performance</p> <p>How should you interpret the difference between the two measures? If you look at the chart of historical prices of <code>share-1</code> and <code>share-2</code>, it is immediately evident that the timing of purchase and sale was rather optimal.</p> <p>???? When the Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWR) is larger than the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), it typically means that you have successfully timed your buys and sells to take advantage of favorable market conditions. In this scenario, your investments have experienced significant growth due to buying low and selling high, which boosts the TWR. The TWR measures the performance of your investments over different time periods, and it doesn't consider the size and timing of your contributions or withdrawals. If these investments were made at opportune moments, it could lead to a TWR that appears more favorable compared to the IRR, which accounts for cash flows and their timing. This demonstrates your skill in making well-timed investment decisions, which can result in a higher TWR.    The calculation is </p> <ul> <li>Suppose you invest $100 in a portfolio that grows by 10% in the first year and 20% in the second year. Your TWR for the two-year period is (1.1 x 1.2) - 1 = 32%.</li> <li>However, if you withdraw $50 at the end of the first year and reinvest it at the beginning of the second year, your IRR for the two-year period is only 15%. This is because your IRR reflects the timing and size of your cash flows, while your TWR does not. To calculate the IRR, you need to find the discount rate that makes the net present value of your cash flows equal to zero.

As mentioned in the discussion about Purchase Value, PP uses the FIFO (First-in, First-out) method to calculate prices and values. \"Moving/weighted average\", however, is another commonly used method.</p> <p>The Purchase Price and the Purchase Price (MA) of <code>share-1</code> are respectively 44.41 EUR and 51.61 EUR; a rather big difference.

The remaining 40 shares are valuated at this price.</li> <li>The FIFO method asserts that the remaining 40 shares are composed of 10 shares of the first purchase and 30 shares of the second purchase. The average price is thus ((10 x 58.82) + (30 x 39.60))/40 = 44.405 EUR.</li> </ul> <p>The available fields under <code>Performance</code> and <code>Dividends</code> are discussed in a separate chapter.</p> <p>With the <code>Attributes</code> option, you can add custom fields to the table.

The fields labeled as <code>Market value**</code>, <code>Purchase Price**</code>, and <code>Profit/Loss**</code> retain the same meaning as their counterparts in the base currency, but they are presented in the foreign currency.</p> <p>For instance, let's consider <code>share-2</code>, which is traded in USD. In the default view, the Market Value is expressed in EUR. If you wish to view that value in USD instead, you can achieve this by adding the <code>Market Value**</code> field.</p> <p>The <code>Distance to SMA</code> is a metric that measures the difference between the current price of a share and the average price of that share over a specified number of past days. The acronym \"SMA\" presumably represents \"Simple Moving Average.\"</p> <p>When you choose to include this column, you'll also need to specify a period, such as 5 days, 20 days, 50 days, or 200 days. Suppose that you want to know the \u0394 to SMA5 (Distance to SMA for a 5 days period) of <code>share-1</code>. The last 5 available prices are: 71.96, 72.00, 72.42, 73.52, and 74.50 EUR; including the latest available on October, 5 (= 71.96 EUR). The calculation is carried out as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Calculate the average price of the last 5 days, including today = (71.96 + ... + 74.50)/5 = 72.88 EUR.</li> <li>Calculate the difference of today's price with the average price = 71.96 - 72.88 = -0.92 EUR.</li> <li>Divide this difference by the average price and convert to a percentage = -0.92/72.88 = -1.26%. The current price (October 5) is 1.26% lower than the average price of the last 5 days.</li> </ol> <p><code>Distance to ATH</code> (All Time High) is a likewise metric that shows how far the current price is from the highest price in the specified period. For example, the highest price of share-1 in the last year was 77.4 EUR. The current price is 71.96 EUR. So the \u0394 ATH 1 year (Distance to ATH for a 1 year period) is equal to (71.96 - 77.4)/77.4 or -7.03%. </p> <p># Available views</p> <p>Using the <code>Reset Columns</code> option in Figure 3, you can revert to the default arrangement of columns.

There are 4 options worth highlighting: frequency which will give you daily prices, outputType gives you a style of JSON that Portfolio Performance can parse, startDate lets you choose how far back to go, and id is the Morningstar reference for the security - so change that value for any other ones you want to use. The order of the options doesn't matter, but I find it easier to put the id at the end for when I'm setting up multiple securities.</p> <p>Now in Portfolio Performance select JSON as the provider in the \"Historical Quotes\" tab of the security, and use the following values (see also figure 1):</p> <pre><code>Feed URL = the link just created\nPath to Date = $.TimeSeries.Security[*].HistoryDetail[*].EndDate\nPath to Close = $.TimeSeries.Security[*].HistoryDetail[*].Value\n</code></pre> <p>Figure 1.

What about DRIP? A dividend is the payment of a part of the company's profit to its shareholders. Sometimes you can choose to receive this dividend in cash or in shares. But how should you register this latter share dividend.</p> <p>For example, at the annual general meeting of the NN Group, the shareholders approved a final dividend of EUR 1.56. The final dividend will be paid either fully in cash, after deduction of withholding tax if applicable, or fully in ordinary shares, at the election of the shareholders. The following example is about the choice dividend (300 shares) of a Dutch company, paid to a non-resident investor. The dividend is 1.56 EUR/share. The converting ratio is 1 new share for 29.43 old shares. The historical quote at the pay date is 45.91 EUR.</p> <ul> <li> <p>you choose for cash dividend. You receive the net amount of 278.46 EUR. 300 shares * 1.56 EUR = 468 EUR minus foreign taxes (15% or 70.2 EUR), minus fees (0 EUR), minus domestic taxes (30% or 119.34 EUR).</p> </li> <li> <p>You choose for share dividend. You receive 10 shares at 45.91 and 5 cash dividends (6.63 EUR). You have to pay some fees (3.50 EUR) and domestic taxes (140.09 EUR).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Theoretically, there is no difference between the two choices. 300 shares/29.43 * 45.91 ~= 300 shares * 1.56 EUR.</p> <p>In this example, the broker doesn't allow share fractions. So, you only receive 10 additional new shares (not 10.19 shares) for 295 old shares and a pay-out of the remaining 5 old shares dividend.</p> <p>The domestic taxes are much larger for the share dividend (30%) than if you should buy the shares from your cash account(0.35%) (140.09 EUR). Of course, if the dividends are paid in cash, then you would also have paid domestic taxes. Either way, the government receives the same amount.</p> <p>In this particular example, there is a small benefit because there are no foreign taxes (15%) in case of a share dividend.</p> <p>There has been a lot of debate about how to book these transactions in PP. My understanding of the proposed procedure is:</p> <ul> <li>book the dividends for all shares without fees and taxes. These will be paid for in the following step. If your broker doesn't allow for share fractions, you can use one transaction for the share dividend part (e.g. 295 in the example) without fees &amp; taxes and another transaction with taxes and fees for the cash dividend. </li> <li>buy the allocated shares at the same day with the theoretical historical quote and the associated fees and taxes.</li> </ul> <p>Figure 1.  Implementation in PP</p> <p>Please note that in this example the total outflow is much larger the inflow from the dividend payment. This is because the number of reinvested shares is calculated on the gross amount. So, all taxes and fees are in surplus of this choice dividend.</p>"},{"location":"reference/","title":"Reference Manual","text":"<p>The Reference manual is structured around the User Interface (UI) of the program, probably the easiest and quickest way for users, developers, or contributors to find relevant information. Figure 1 shows a typical opening screen of a small portfolio, e.g. demo-portfolio-04.</p> <p>Figure 1.  Opening screen of the PortfolioPerformance program.</p> <p>Figure 1 illustrates the outcome of selecting the <code>All Transactions</code> view, accessible either through the side panel or the menu <code>View &gt; All Transactions</code>. The last Buy transaction for <code>share-3</code> is selected, prompting the display of a chart showing the historical quotes of <code>share-3</code> in the lower panel. The following UI elements can be distinguished:</p> <ul> <li>Menu bar containing five elements: File, View, Transaction, Online, Help. This menu bar is not context sensitive.</li> <li>Open projects: you can open multiple projects simultaneously. The highlighted project is visible in the panels below. Projects marked with a star (*) preceding their name has been changed and should be saved before closing. It is possible to display two projects side by side in the UI.</li> <li>The Side panel serves as a convenient shortcut for accessing various views within the project. All available options can also be accessed through the <code>View</code> menu. It's important to note that the list in the side panel mirrors the options available in the <code>View</code> menu, providing a one-to-one translation of the available views. The chosen view dictates the content displayed in the adjacent top and bottom panels. Next to the options <code>Securities</code> and <code>Taxonomies</code>, a very small (green) icon will let you add new elements.</li> <li>Top panel: in the example of Figure 1, the top panel contains the <code>All Transactions</code> view. This is a list of all the transactions that you have made with your portfolio, such as deposits, withdrawals, buys, and sells. The default columns, such as <code>date</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>security</code>, ..., are initially visible. However, you have the flexibility to modify them using the Settings (cog) icon located in the top-right corner. Please, note that the icons in the top-right corner are specific to this view and may not necessarily appear in other views.</li> <li>The Bottom panel follows the selection of the top panel. For example, selecting <code>share-1</code> in the top panel will display the chart of this share in the bottom panel.</li> <li>Divider bar: the area occupied by the top and bottom panels can be adjusted using the divider bar. You can drag the divider bar all the way to the top or bottom. It is not possible to completely hide a panel; except for the <code>Currencies</code> and <code>Settings</code> options.</li> </ul>"}]}
